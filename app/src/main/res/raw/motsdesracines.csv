8217,0.208333333,1424,(in) anything.
8218,0.208333333,51,Indeed
8219,0.208333333,25,Allah
8220,0.208333333,251,of what
8221,0.208333333,133,they do
8222,0.208333333,636,(is) All-Encompassing.
8223,0.209027778,78,And when
8224,0.209027778,452,you left early morning
8225,0.209027778,974,from
8226,0.209027778,15,your household
8227,0.209027778,290,to post
8228,0.209027778,42,the believers
8229,0.209027778,1130,(to take) positions
8230,0.209027778,1193,for the battle.
8231,0.209027778,25,And Allah
8232,0.209027778,1487,(is) All-Hearing
8233,0.209027778,126,All-Knowing.
8234,0.209722222,78,When
8235,0.209722222,519,inclined
8236,0.209722222,1595,two parties
8237,0.209722222,974,among you
8238,0.209722222,47,that
8239,0.209722222,418,they lost heart
8240,0.209722222,25,but Allah
8241,0.209722222,1688,(was) their protector.
8242,0.209722222,130,And on
8243,0.209722222,25,Allah
8244,0.209722222,1684,let put (their) trust
8245,0.209722222,42,the believers.
8246,0.210416667,1140,And certainly
8247,0.210416667,1089,helped you
8248,0.210416667,25,Allah
8249,0.210416667,223,in Badr
8250,0.210416667,56,while you (were)
8251,0.210416667,1638,weak.
8252,0.210416667,1697,So fear
8253,0.210416667,25,Allah
8254,0.210416667,870,so that you may
8255,0.210416667,1391,(be) grateful.
8256,0.211111111,78,When
8257,0.211111111,1205,you said
8258,0.211111111,42,to the believers
8259,0.211111111,907,"""Is it not"
8260,0.211111111,744,enough for you
8261,0.211111111,47,that

8263,0.211111111,1219,your Lord
8264,0.211111111,1611,with three

8274,0.211805556,974,[of]
8275,0.211805556,436,suddenly
8276,0.211805556,500,[this]
8277,0.211805556,943,will reinforce you

8284,0.2125,933,And not
8285,0.2125,655,made it
8286,0.2125,25,Allah

8288,0.2125,273,(as) good news
8289,0.2125,865,for you
8290,0.2125,1583,and to reassure
8291,0.2125,1152,your hearts
8292,0.2125,208,with it.
8293,0.2125,933,And (there is) no

8299,0.2125,207,the All-Mighty
8300,0.2125,572,the All-Wise.
8301,0.213194444,1196,That He may cut off
8302,0.213194444,1587,a part
8303,0.213194444,974,of
8304,0.213194444,29,those who
8305,0.213194444,742,disbelieved
8306,0.213194444,82,or
8307,0.213194444,735,suppress them
8308,0.213194444,1152,so (that) they turn back
8309,0.213194444,858,disappointed.
8310,0.213888889,928,Not
8311,0.213888889,865,for you
8312,0.213888889,974,of

8319,0.213888889,184,punishes them
8320,0.213888889,51,for indeed they
8321,0.213888889,1755,(are) wrongdoers.
8322,0.214583333,25,And to Allah (belongs)
8323,0.214583333,933,what

8470,0.222222222,25,And Allah
8471,0.222222222,866,(does) not
8472,0.222222222,551,love
8473,0.222222222,1755,the wrongdoers.
8474,0.222916667,953,And so that Allah may purify

8480,0.223611111,37,Or
8481,0.223611111,617,do you think
8482,0.223611111,47,that
8483,0.223611111,342,you will enter
8484,0.223611111,693,Paradise
8485,0.223611111,904,while Allah has not yet made evident

8493,0.224305556,1140,And certainly
8494,0.224305556,785,you used to
8495,0.224305556,978,wish
8496,0.224305556,1010,(for) death
8497,0.224305556,974,before
8498,0.224305556,1134,before
8499,0.224305556,47,[that]
8500,0.224305556,913,you met it
8501,0.224305556,1140,then indeed
8502,0.224305556,1214,you have seen it
8503,0.224305556,56,while you (were)
8504,0.224305556,1124,looking on.
8505,0.225,933,And not

8516,0.225,82,or

10568,04:37,241,[of] stinginess
10569,04:37,778,and hide
10570,04:37,933,what
10571,04:37,73,Allah (has) given them
10572,04:37,25,Allah (has) given them
10573,04:37,974,of
10574,04:37,377,His Bounty -
10575,04:37,175,and We (have) prepared
10576,04:37,742,for the disbelievers
10577,04:37,184,a punishment
10578,04:37,536,humiliating.
10579,04:38,29,And those who
10580,04:38,1043,spend
10581,04:38,1007,their wealth
10582,04:38,1214,to be seen
10583,04:38,1120,(by) the people
10584,04:38,866,and not
10585,04:38,42,they believe
10586,04:38,25,in Allah
10587,04:38,866,and not
10588,04:38,1750,in the Day
10589,04:38,21,the Last
10590,04:38,974,and whoever
10591,04:38,785,has
10592,04:38,1416,the Shaitaan
10593,04:38,865,for him
10594,04:38,1175,(as) companion -
10595,04:38,1523,then evil
10596,04:38,1175,(is he as) a companion.
10597,04:39,935,And what
10598,04:39,130,(is) against them
10599,04:39,917,if
10600,04:39,42,they believed
10601,04:39,25,in Allah
10602,04:39,1750,and the Day
10603,04:39,21,the Last
10604,04:39,1043,and spent
10605,04:39,973,from what
10606,04:39,1301,Allah (has) provided them?
10607,04:39,25,Allah (has) provided them?
10608,04:39,785,And Allah is
10609,04:39,25,And Allah is
10610,04:39,208,about them
10611,04:39,126,All-Knower.
10612,04:40,51,Indeed
10613,04:40,25,Allah
10614,04:40,866,(does) not
10615,04:40,1755,wrong
10616,04:40,1619,(as much as) weight
10617,04:40,1644,(of) an atom.
10618,04:40,47,And if
10619,04:40,785,there is
10620,04:40,620,a good
10621,04:40,301,He doubles it
10622,04:40,73,and gives
10623,04:40,974,from
10624,04:40,878,near Him
10625,04:40,19,a reward
10626,04:40,201,great.
10627,04:41,790,So how (ill it be)
10628,04:41,79,when
10629,04:41,720,We bring
10630,04:41,974,from
10631,04:41,753,every
10632,04:41,40,nation
10633,04:41,1381,a witness
10634,04:41,720,and We bring
10635,04:41,208,you
10636,04:41,130,against
10637,04:41,87,these (people)
10638,04:41,1381,(as) a witness.
10639,04:42,1750,(On) that Day
10640,04:42,1661,will wish
10641,04:42,29,those who
10642,04:42,742,disbelieved
10643,04:42,166,and disobeyed
10644,04:42,1283,the Messenger
10645,04:42,917,if
10646,04:42,1534,was leveled
10647,04:42,208,with them
10648,04:42,61,the earth
10649,04:42,866,and not
10650,04:42,778,they will (be able to) hide
10651,04:42,25,(from) Allah
10652,04:42,562,(any) statement.
10653,04:43,96,O you
10654,04:43,29,who
10655,04:43,42,believe[d]!
10656,04:43,866,(Do) not
10657,04:43,1170,go near
10658,04:43,1339,the prayer
10659,04:43,56,while you
10660,04:43,1471,(are) intoxicated
10661,04:43,624,until
10662,04:43,126,you know
10663,04:43,933,what
10664,04:43,1205,you are saying
10665,04:43,866,and not
10666,04:43,689,(when you are) impure
10667,04:43,27,except
10668,04:43,103,(when) passing
10669,04:43,1439,(through) a way
10670,04:43,624,until
10671,04:43,478,you have bathed.
10672,04:43,47,And if
10673,04:43,785,you are
10674,04:43,981,ill
10675,04:43,82,or
10676,04:43,130,on
10677,04:43,1453,a journey
10678,04:43,82,or
10679,04:43,720,came
10680,04:43,16,one
10681,04:43,974,of you
10682,04:43,974,from
10683,04:43,486,the toilet
10684,04:43,82,or
10685,04:43,905,you have touched
10686,04:43,1103,the women
10687,04:43,900,and not
10688,04:43,1677,you find
10689,04:43,1005,water
10690,04:43,1736,then do
10691,04:43,1303,(with) earth
10692,04:43,1600,clean
10693,04:43,994,and wipe (with it)
10694,04:43,1679,your faces
10695,04:43,1732,and your hands.
10696,04:43,51,Indeed
10697,04:43,25,Allah
10698,04:43,785,is
10699,04:43,117,Oft-Pardoning
10700,04:43,454,Oft-Forgiving.
10701,04:44,900,Did not
10702,04:44,1214,you see
10703,04:44,36,[towards]
10704,04:44,29,those who
10705,04:44,73,were given
10706,04:44,1086,a portion
10707,04:44,974,of
10708,04:44,777,the Book
10709,04:44,1412,purchasing
10710,04:44,311,[the] error
10711,04:44,1293,and wishing
10712,04:44,47,that
10713,04:44,311,you stray
10714,04:44,1439,(from) the way?
10715,04:45,25,And Allah
10716,04:45,126,knows better
10717,04:45,114,about your enemies
10718,04:45,744,and Allah (is) sufficient
10719,04:45,25,and Allah (is) sufficient
10720,04:45,1688,(as) a Protector
10721,04:45,744,and sufficient
10722,04:45,25,(is) Allah
10723,04:45,1089,(as) a Helper.
10724,04:46,974,Of
10725,04:46,29,those who
10726,04:46,535,are Jews
10727,04:46,599,they distort
10728,04:46,754,the words
10729,04:46,139,from
10730,04:46,1658,their places
10731,04:46,1205,and they say
10732,04:46,1487,"""We hear[d]"
10733,04:46,166,"and we disobey[ed]"""
10734,04:46,1487,"and ""Hear"
10735,04:46,491,not
10736,04:46,1487,to be heard
10737,04:46,1217,"and ""Raina"""
10738,04:46,925,twisting
10739,04:46,914,[with] their tongues
10740,04:46,1564,and defaming
10741,04:46,439,[in]
10742,04:46,371,the religion.
10743,04:46,917,And if
10744,04:46,51,[that] they
10745,04:46,1205,(had) said
10746,04:46,1487,"""We hear[d]"
10747,04:46,1593,"and we obey[ed]"""
10748,04:46,1487,"and ""Hear"
10749,04:46,1124,and look (at) us
10750,04:46,785,surely it (would) have been
10751,04:46,861,better
10752,04:46,865,for them
10753,04:46,1206,and more suitable.
10754,04:46,899,[And] but
10755,04:46,871,Allah cursed them
10756,04:46,25,Allah cursed them
10757,04:46,742,for their disbelief
10758,04:46,866,so not
10759,04:46,42,they believe
10760,04:46,27,except
10761,04:46,1154,a few.
10762,04:47,96,O you
10763,04:47,29,who
10764,04:47,73,(have) been given
10765,04:47,777,the Book
10766,04:47,42,believe
10767,04:47,251,in what
10768,04:47,1128,We (have) revealed
10769,04:47,1317,confirming
10770,04:47,901,what is
10771,04:47,937,with you
10772,04:47,974,before
10773,04:47,1134,before
10774,04:47,47,[that]
10775,04:47,1584,We efface
10776,04:47,1679,faces
10777,04:47,1228,and turn them
10778,04:47,130,on
10779,04:47,329,their backs
10780,04:47,82,or
10781,04:47,871,We curse them
10782,04:47,757,as
10783,04:47,871,We cursed
10784,04:47,1330,companions
10785,04:47,1441,(of) the Sabbath.
10786,04:47,785,And is
10787,04:47,43,(the) command of Allah
10788,04:47,25,(the) command of Allah
10789,04:47,374,(always) executed.
10790,04:48,51,Indeed
10791,04:48,25,Allah
10792,04:48,866,(does) not
10793,04:48,454,forgive
10794,04:48,47,that
10795,04:48,1407,partners be associated
10796,04:48,208,with Him
10797,04:48,454,but He forgives
10798,04:48,933,other than
10799,04:48,369,other than
10800,04:48,1637,that
10801,04:48,974,for whom
10802,04:48,1424,He wills.
10803,04:48,974,And whoever
10804,04:48,1407,associates partners
10805,04:48,25,with Allah
10806,04:48,1140,then surely
10807,04:48,414,he has fabricated
10808,04:48,75,a sin -
10809,04:48,201,tremendous.
10810,04:49,900,Do not
10811,04:49,1214,you see
10812,04:49,36,[towards]
10813,04:49,29,those who
10814,04:49,1773,claim purity
10815,04:49,1046,(for) themselves?
10816,04:49,243,Nay
10817,04:49,25,(it is) Allah
10818,04:49,1773,He purifies
10819,04:49,974,whom
10820,04:49,1424,He wills
10821,04:49,866,and not
10822,04:49,1755,they will be wronged
10823,04:49,425,(even as much as) a hair on a date-seed.
10824,04:50,1124,See
10825,04:50,790,how
10826,04:50,414,they invent
10827,04:50,130,about
10828,04:50,25,Allah
10829,04:50,781,[the] lie
10830,04:50,744,and sufficient
10831,04:50,208,is it -
10832,04:50,75,(as) a sin
10833,04:50,297,manifest.
10834,04:51,900,Do not
10835,04:51,1214,you see
10836,04:51,36,[towards]
10837,04:51,29,those who
10838,04:51,73,were given
10839,04:51,1086,a portion
10840,04:51,974,of
10841,04:51,777,the Book?
10842,04:51,42,They believe
10843,04:51,661,in the superstition
10844,04:51,1571,and the false deities
10845,04:51,1205,and they say
10846,04:51,29,for those who
10847,04:51,742,disbelieve[d]
10848,04:51,87,"""These"
10849,04:51,507,(are) better guided
10850,04:51,974,than
10851,04:51,29,those who
10852,04:51,42,believe[d]
10853,04:51,1439,(as to the) way.
10854,04:52,87,Those
10855,04:52,29,(are) the ones
10856,04:52,871,(whom) Allah (has) cursed
10857,04:52,25,(whom) Allah (has) cursed
10858,04:52,974,and whoever
10859,04:52,871,Allah curses
10860,04:52,25,Allah curses
10861,04:52,907,then never
10862,04:52,1677,will you find
10863,04:52,865,for him
10864,04:52,1089,(any) helper.
10865,04:53,37,Or
10866,04:53,865,for them
10867,04:53,1086,(is) a share
10868,04:53,974,of
10869,04:53,968,the Kingdom?
10870,04:53,79,Then
10871,04:53,866,they would not give
10872,04:53,73,they would not give
10873,04:53,1120,the people
10874,04:53,1083,(even as much as the) speck on a date seed.
10875,04:54,37,Or
10876,04:54,618,are they jealous
10877,04:54,1120,(of) the people
10878,04:54,130,for
10879,04:54,933,what
10880,04:54,73,Allah gave them
10881,04:54,25,Allah gave them
10882,04:54,974,from
10883,04:54,377,His Bounty?
10884,04:54,1140,But surely
10885,04:54,73,We gave
10886,04:54,86,(the) family
10887,04:54,5,(of) Ibrahim
10888,04:54,777,the Book
10889,04:54,572,and [the] wisdom
10890,04:54,73,and [We] gave them
10891,04:54,968,a kingdom
10892,04:54,201,great.
10893,04:55,974,Then of them
10894,04:55,974,(are some) who
10895,04:55,42,believed
10896,04:55,208,in him
10897,04:55,974,and of them
10898,04:55,974,(are some) who
10899,04:55,1315,turned away
10900,04:55,139,from
10901,04:55,744,and sufficient
10902,04:55,672,(is) Hell
10903,04:55,1432,(as a) Blazing Fire.
10904,04:56,51,Indeed
10905,04:56,29,those who
10906,04:56,742,disbelieved
10907,04:56,90,in Our Signs
10908,04:56,1526,soon
10909,04:56,1340,We will burn them
10910,04:56,1117,(in) a Fire.
10911,04:56,753,Every time
10912,04:56,1032,are roasted
10913,04:56,678,their skins
10914,04:56,221,We will change their
10915,04:56,678,skins
10916,04:56,491,for other (than) that
10917,04:56,1648,so that they may
10918,04:56,184,the punishment.
10919,04:56,51,Indeed
10920,04:56,25,Allah
10921,04:56,785,is
10922,04:56,207,All-Mighty
10923,04:56,572,All-Wise.
10924,04:57,29,And those who
10925,04:57,42,believe[d]
10926,04:57,133,and did
10927,04:57,1337,the good deeds
10928,04:57,342,We will admit them
10929,04:57,693,(in) Gardens
10930,04:57,701,flows
10931,04:57,974,from
10932,04:57,1546,underneath it
10933,04:57,1052,the rivers
10934,04:57,813,will abide
10935,04:57,439,in it
10936,04:57,2,forever.
10937,04:57,865,For them
10938,04:57,439,in it
10939,04:57,1792,(are) spouses
10940,04:57,1573,pure

12452,0.255555556,796,All-Aware.
12453,0.25625,907,And never

12652,0.263194444,228,Do they seek

14454,05:42,152,you turn away
14455,05:42,139,from them
14456,05:42,907,then never
14457,05:42,318,will they harm you
14458,05:42,1424,(in) anything.
14459,05:42,47,And if
14460,05:42,572,you judge
14461,05:42,572,then judge
14462,05:42,297,between them
14463,05:42,1190,with [the] justice.
14464,05:42,51,Indeed
14465,05:42,25,Allah
14466,05:42,551,loves
14467,05:42,1190,the ones who are just.
14468,05:43,790,But how can
14469,05:43,572,they appoint you a judge
14470,05:43,141,while they (have) with them
14471,05:43,1560,the Taurat
14472,05:43,439,in it
14473,05:43,572,(is the) Command
14474,05:43,25,(of) Allah?
14475,05:43,1613,Then
14476,05:43,1688,they turn away
14477,05:43,974,after
14478,05:43,213,after
14479,05:43,1637,that
14480,05:43,933,and not
14481,05:43,87,those
14482,05:43,42,(are) the believers.
14483,05:44,51,Indeed
14484,05:44,1128,We revealed
14485,05:44,1560,the Taurat
14486,05:44,439,in it
14487,05:44,507,(was) Guidance
14488,05:44,1117,and light;
14489,05:44,572,judged
14490,05:44,208,by it
14491,05:44,1025,the Prophets
14492,05:44,29,those who
14493,05:44,1481,had submitted (to Allah)
14494,05:44,29,for those who
14495,05:44,535,were Jews
14496,05:44,1219,and the Rabbis
14497,05:44,554,and the scholars
14498,05:44,251,with what
14499,05:44,567,they were entrusted
14500,05:44,974,of
14501,05:44,777,(the) Book
14502,05:44,25,(of) Allah
14503,05:44,785,and they were
14504,05:44,130,to it
14505,05:44,1381,witnesses.
14506,05:44,866,So (do) not
14507,05:44,840,fear
14508,05:44,1120,the people
14509,05:44,840,but fear Me
14510,05:44,866,and (do) not
14511,05:44,1412,sell
14512,05:44,90,My Verses
14513,05:44,1614,(for) a little price.
14514,05:44,1154,(for) a little price.
14515,05:44,974,And whoever
14516,05:44,900,(does) not
14517,05:44,572,judge
14518,05:44,251,by what
14519,05:44,1128,Allah has revealed
14520,05:44,25,Allah has revealed
14521,05:44,87,then those
14522,05:44,516,[they]
14523,05:44,742,(are) the disbelievers.
14524,05:45,777,And We ordained
14525,05:45,130,for them
14526,05:45,439,in it
14527,05:45,51,that -
14528,05:45,1046,the life
14529,05:45,1046,for the life
14530,05:45,196,and the eye
14531,05:45,196,for the eye
14532,05:45,49,and the nose
14533,05:45,49,for the nose
14534,05:45,80,and the ear
14535,05:45,80,for the ear
14536,05:45,1499,and the tooth
14537,05:45,1499,for the tooth
14538,05:45,698,and (for) wounds
14539,05:45,1184,(is) retribution.
14540,05:45,974,But whoever
14541,05:45,1317,gives it (up as) charity
14542,05:45,208,gives it (up as) charity
14543,05:45,534,then it is
14544,05:45,742,an expiation
14545,05:45,865,for him.
14546,05:45,974,And whoever
14547,05:45,900,(does) not
14548,05:45,572,judge
14549,05:45,251,by what
14550,05:45,1128,Allah has revealed
14551,05:45,25,Allah has revealed
14552,05:45,87,then those
14553,05:45,516,[they]
14554,05:45,1755,(are) the wrongdoers.
14555,05:46,1148,And We sent
14556,05:46,130,on
14557,05:46,76,their footsteps
14558,05:46,199,Isa
14559,05:46,254,son
14560,05:46,989,(of) Maryam
14561,05:46,1317,confirming
14562,05:46,901,what
14563,05:46,297,(was) before him
14564,05:46,1732,(was) before him
14565,05:46,974,of
14566,05:46,1560,the Taurat
14567,05:46,73,and We gave him
14568,05:46,1061,the Injeel
14569,05:46,439,in it
14570,05:46,507,(was) Guidance
14571,05:46,1117,and light
14572,05:46,1317,and confirming
14573,05:46,901,what
14574,05:46,297,(was) before him
14575,05:46,1732,(was) before him
14576,05:46,974,of
14577,05:46,1560,the Taurat
14578,05:46,507,and a Guidance
14579,05:46,1654,and an admonition
14580,05:46,1697,for the God conscious.
14581,05:47,572,And let judge
14582,05:47,15,(the) People
14583,05:47,1061,(of) the Injeel
14584,05:47,251,by what
14585,05:47,1128,Allah has revealed
14586,05:47,25,Allah has revealed
14587,05:47,439,in it.
14588,05:47,974,And whoever
14589,05:47,900,(does) not
14590,05:47,572,judge
14591,05:47,251,by what
14592,05:47,1128,Allah revealed
14593,05:47,25,Allah revealed
14594,05:47,87,then those
14595,05:47,516,[they] (are)
14596,05:47,421,the defiantly disobedient.
14597,05:48,1128,And We revealed
14598,05:48,36,to you
14599,05:48,777,the Book
14600,05:48,595,in [the] truth
14601,05:48,1317,confirming
14602,05:48,901,what
14603,05:48,297,(was) before it
14604,05:48,1732,(was) before it
14605,05:48,974,of
14606,05:48,777,the Book
14607,05:48,520,and a guardian
14608,05:48,130,over it.
14609,05:48,572,So judge
14610,05:48,297,between them
14611,05:48,251,by what
14612,05:48,1128,Allah has revealed
14613,05:48,25,Allah has revealed
14614,05:48,866,and (do) not
14615,05:48,1542,follow
14616,05:48,538,their vain desires
14617,05:48,135,when
14618,05:48,720,has come to you
14619,05:48,974,of
14620,05:48,595,the truth.
14621,05:48,753,For each
14622,05:48,655,We have made
14623,05:48,974,for you
14624,05:48,1403,a law
14625,05:48,1051,and a clear way.
14626,05:48,917,And if
14627,05:48,1424,Allah (had) willed
14628,05:48,25,Allah (had) willed
14629,05:48,655,He (would have) made you
14630,05:48,40,one community
14631,05:48,1673,one community
14632,05:48,899,[and] but
14633,05:48,248,to test you
14634,05:48,439,in
14635,05:48,933,what
14636,05:48,73,He (has) given you
14637,05:48,1440,so race
14638,05:48,861,(to) the good.
14639,05:48,36,To
14640,05:48,25,Allah
14641,05:48,1250,you will all return
14642,05:48,683,you will all return
14643,05:48,1025,then He will inform you
14644,05:48,251,of what
14645,05:48,785,you were
14646,05:48,439,concerning it
14647,05:48,814,differing.
14648,05:49,47,And that
14649,05:49,572,you judge
14650,05:49,297,between them
14651,05:49,251,by what
14652,05:49,1128,Allah (has) revealed
14653,05:49,25,Allah (has) revealed
14654,05:49,866,and (do) not
14655,05:49,1542,follow
14656,05:49,538,their vain desires
14657,05:49,629,and beware of them
14658,05:49,47,lest
14659,05:49,426,they tempt you away
14660,05:49,139,from
14661,05:49,212,some
14662,05:49,933,(of) what
14663,05:49,1128,Allah has revealed
14664,05:49,25,Allah has revealed
14665,05:49,36,to you.
14666,05:49,47,And if
14667,05:49,1688,they turn away
14668,05:49,126,then know that
14669,05:49,52,only
14670,05:49,1293,Allah intends
14671,05:49,25,Allah intends
14672,05:49,47,to
14673,05:49,1357,afflict them
14674,05:49,212,for some
14675,05:49,1640,(of) their sins.
14676,05:49,51,And indeed
14677,05:49,780,many
14678,05:49,974,of
14679,05:49,1120,the people
14680,05:49,421,(are) defiantly disobedient.
14681,05:50,572,Is it then the judgment
14682,05:50,671,of [the] ignorance
14683,05:50,228,they seek?
14684,05:50,974,And who (is)
14685,05:50,620,better
14686,05:50,974,than
14687,05:50,25,Allah
14688,05:50,572,(in) judgment
14689,05:50,1206,for a people
14690,05:50,1740,(who) firmly believe.
14691,05:51,96,O you
14692,05:51,29,who
14693,05:51,42,believe!
14694,05:51,866,(Do) not
14695,05:51,22,take
14696,05:51,1734,the Jews
14697,05:51,1089,and the Christians
14698,05:51,1688,(as) allies.
14699,05:51,212,Some of them
14700,05:51,1688,(are) allies
14701,05:51,212,(to) others.
14702,05:51,974,And whoever
14703,05:51,1688,takes them as allies
14704,05:51,974,among you
14705,05:51,51,then indeed he
14706,05:51,974,(is) of them.
14707,05:51,51,Indeed
14708,05:51,25,Allah
14709,05:51,866,(does) not
14710,05:51,507,guide
14711,05:51,1206,the wrongdoing people.
14712,05:51,1755,the wrongdoing people.
14713,05:52,1214,And you see

23067,08:34,1697,the ones who fear Allah
23068,08:34,899,but
23069,08:34,780,most of them
23070,08:34,866,(do) not
23071,08:34,126,know.
23072,08:35,933,And not
23073,08:35,785,was
23074,08:35,1339,their prayer
23075,08:35,141,at
23076,08:35,298,the House
23077,08:35,27,except
23078,08:35,963,whistling
23079,08:35,1319,and clapping.
23080,08:35,1648,So taste
23081,08:35,184,the punishment

23083,08:35,785,you used to
23084,08:35,742,disbelieve.
23085,08:36,51,Indeed
23086,08:36,29,those who
23087,08:36,742,disbelieve
23088,08:36,1043,they spend
23089,08:36,1007,their wealth
23090,08:36,1315,to hinder (people)
23091,08:36,139,from
23092,08:36,1439,(the) way
23093,08:36,25,(of) Allah.
23094,08:36,1043,So they will spend it
23095,08:36,1613,then
23096,08:36,785,it will be
23097,08:36,130,for them
23098,08:36,621,a regret
23099,08:36,1613,then
23100,08:36,455,they will be overcome.
23101,08:36,29,And those who
23102,08:36,742,disbelieve
23103,08:36,36,to
23104,08:36,672,Hell
23105,08:36,616,they will be gathered.
23106,08:37,1014,That Allah may distinguish
23107,08:37,25,That Allah may distinguish
23108,08:37,799,the wicked
23109,08:37,974,from
23110,08:37,1600,the good
23111,08:37,655,and place
23112,08:37,799,the wicked
23113,08:37,212,some of them
23114,08:37,130,on
23115,08:37,212,others
23116,08:37,1262,and heap them
23117,08:37,683,all together
23118,08:37,655,and put them
23119,08:37,439,in
23120,08:37,672,Hell.
23121,08:37,87,Those -
23122,08:37,516,they
23123,08:37,843,(are) the losers.
23124,08:38,1205,Say
23125,08:38,29,to those who
23126,08:38,742,disbelieve
23127,08:38,47,if
23128,08:38,1053,they cease
23129,08:38,454,will be forgiven
23130,08:38,865,for them
23131,08:38,933,what
23132,08:38,1140,[verily]
23133,08:38,1476,(is) past.
23134,08:38,47,But if
23135,08:38,186,they return
23136,08:38,1140,then verily
23137,08:38,942,preceded
23138,08:38,1499,(the) practice
23139,08:38,86,(of) the former (people).
23140,08:39,1193,And fight them
23141,08:39,624,until
23142,08:39,866,there is no
23143,08:39,785,there is no
23144,08:39,426,oppression
23145,08:39,785,and is
23146,08:39,371,the religion
23147,08:39,753,all of it
23148,08:39,25,for Allah.
23149,08:39,47,But if
23150,08:39,1053,they cease
23151,08:39,51,then indeed
23152,08:39,25,Allah
23153,08:39,251,of what
23154,08:39,133,they do
23155,08:39,272,(is) All-Seer.
23156,08:40,47,And if
23157,08:40,1688,they turn away
23158,08:40,126,then know
23159,08:40,51,that
23160,08:40,25,Allah
23161,08:40,1688,(is) your Protector
23162,08:40,1022,Excellent
23163,08:40,1688,(is) the Protector
23164,08:40,1022,and Excellent
23165,08:40,1089,(is) the Helper.
23166,08:41,126,And know
23167,08:41,52,that what
23168,08:41,467,you obtain (as) spoils of war
23169,08:41,974,of
23170,08:41,1424,anything
23171,08:41,51,then that
23172,08:41,25,for Allah
23173,08:41,823,(is) one fifth of it
23174,08:41,1283,and for the Messenger
23175,08:41,1646,and for the near relatives
23176,08:41,1170,and for the near relatives
23177,08:41,1748,and the orphans
23178,08:41,1470,and the needy
23179,08:41,254,and the wayfarer
23180,08:41,1439,and the wayfarer
23181,08:41,47,if
23182,08:41,785,you
23183,08:41,42,believe
23184,08:41,25,in Allah
23185,08:41,933,and (in) what
23186,08:41,1128,We sent down
23187,08:41,130,to
23188,08:41,101,Our slave
23189,08:41,1750,(on the) day
23190,08:41,408,(of) the criterion
23191,08:41,1750,(the) day
23192,08:41,913,(when) met
23193,08:41,683,the two forces.
23194,08:41,25,And Allah
23195,08:41,130,(is) on
23196,08:41,753,every
23197,08:41,1424,thing
23198,08:41,1144,All-Powerful.
23199,08:42,78,When
23200,08:42,56,you (were)
23201,08:42,114,on the nearer side of the valley
23202,08:42,354,on the nearer side of the valley
23203,08:42,516,and they
23204,08:42,114,(were) on the farther side
23205,08:42,1185,(were) on the farther side
23206,08:42,1259,and the caravan
23207,08:42,1451,(was) lower
23208,08:42,974,than you.
23209,08:42,917,And if
23210,08:42,1652,you (had) made an appointment
23211,08:42,814,certainly you would have failed
23212,08:42,439,in
23213,08:42,1652,the appointment.
23214,08:42,899,But
23215,08:42,1139,that Allah might accomplish
23216,08:42,25,that Allah might accomplish
23217,08:42,43,a matter
23218,08:42,785,(that) was
23219,08:42,374,destined
23220,08:42,513,that (might be) destroyed
23221,08:42,974,(those) who
23222,08:42,513,(were to be) destroyed
23223,08:42,139,on
23224,08:42,297,a clear evidence
23225,08:42,648,and (might) live
23226,08:42,974,(those) who
23227,08:42,648,(were to) live
23228,08:42,139,on
23229,08:42,297,a clear evidence.
23230,08:42,51,And indeed
23231,08:42,25,Allah
23232,08:42,1487,(is) All-Hearing
23233,08:42,126,All-Knowing.
23234,08:43,78,When
23235,08:43,1214,Allah showed them to you
23236,08:43,25,Allah showed them to you
23237,08:43,439,in
23238,08:43,1114,your dream
23239,08:43,1154,(as) few
23240,08:43,917,and if
23241,08:43,1214,He had shown them to you
23242,08:43,780,(as) many
23243,08:43,418,surely you would have lost courage
23244,08:43,1125,and surely you would have disputed
23245,08:43,439,in
23246,08:43,43,the matter
23247,08:43,899,but
23248,08:43,25,Allah
23249,08:43,1481,saved (you).
23250,08:43,51,Indeed He
23251,08:43,126,(is) All-Knower
23252,08:43,1646,of what is in the breasts.
23253,08:43,1318,of what is in the breasts.
23254,08:44,78,And when
23255,08:44,1214,He showed them to you
23256,08:44,78,when
23257,08:44,913,you met -
23258,08:44,439,in
23259,08:44,196,your eyes
23260,08:44,1154,(as) few
23261,08:44,1154,and He made you (appear) as few
23262,08:44,439,in
23263,08:44,196,their eyes
23264,08:44,1139,that Allah might accomplish
23265,08:44,25,that Allah might accomplish
23266,08:44,43,a matter
23267,08:44,785,(that) was
23268,08:44,374,(already) destined.
23269,08:44,36,And to
23270,08:44,25,Allah
23271,08:44,1250,return
23272,08:44,43,(all) the matters.
23273,08:45,96,O you who believe!
23274,08:45,29,O you who believe!
23275,08:45,42,O you who believe!
23276,08:45,79,When
23277,08:45,913,you meet
23278,08:45,373,a force
23279,08:45,1605,then be firm
23280,08:45,1634,and remember
23281,08:45,25,Allah
23282,08:45,780,much
23283,08:45,870,so that you may
23284,08:45,389,(be) successful.
23285,08:46,1593,And obey
23286,08:46,25,Allah
23287,08:46,1283,and His Messenger
23288,08:46,866,and (do) not
23289,08:46,1125,dispute
23290,08:46,418,lest you lose courage

23292,08:46,1295,your strength
23293,08:46,1311,and be patient.
23294,08:46,51,Indeed
23295,08:46,25,Allah
23296,08:46,937,(is) with
23297,08:46,1311,the patient ones.
23298,08:47,866,And (do) not

23437,08:54,472,and We drowned
23438,08:54,86,(the) people of Firaun
23439,08:54,400,(the) people of Firaun
23440,08:54,753,and (they) all
23441,08:54,785,were
23442,08:54,1755,wrongdoers.
23443,08:55,51,Indeed
23444,08:55,1409,(the) worst
23445,08:55,328,(of) the living creatures
23446,08:55,141,near
23447,08:55,25,Allah
23448,08:55,29,(are) those who
23449,08:55,742,disbelieve
23450,08:55,516,and they
23451,08:55,866,(will) not
23452,08:55,42,believe.
23453,08:56,29,Those who -
23454,08:56,118,you made a covenant with them
23455,08:56,974,you made a covenant with them
23456,08:56,1613,then
23457,08:56,1081,they break
23458,08:56,118,their covenant
23459,08:56,439,[in] every
23460,08:56,753,[in] every
23461,08:56,985,time
23462,08:56,516,and they
23463,08:56,866,(do) not
23464,08:56,1697,fear (Allah).
23465,08:57,41,So if
23466,08:57,1618,you gain dominance over them
23467,08:57,439,in
23468,08:57,596,the war
23469,08:57,1405,disperse

23471,08:57,974,(those) who

23473,08:57,870,so that they may
23474,08:57,1634,take heed.
23475,08:58,41,And if
23476,08:58,853,you fear

23482,08:58,130,on
23483,08:58,1534,equal (terms).
23484,08:58,51,Indeed
23485,08:58,25,Allah
23486,08:58,866,(does) not
23487,08:58,551,love
23488,08:58,855,the traitors.
23489,08:59,866,And (let) not
23490,08:59,617,think
23491,08:59,29,those who
23492,08:59,742,disbelieve

23494,08:59,51,Indeed they

23496,08:59,124,escape.
23497,0.375,110,And prepare
23498,0.375,865,for them
23499,0.375,933,whatever
23500,0.375,1593,you able (to)

23508,0.375,114,(the) enemy of Allah
23509,0.375,25,(the) enemy of Allah
23510,0.375,114,and your enemy
23511,0.375,21,and others
23512,0.375,974,besides them
23513,0.375,369,besides them
23514,0.375,866,you (do) not know them
23515,0.375,126,you (do) not know them
23516,0.375,25,(but) Allah
23517,0.375,126,knows them.
23518,0.375,933,And whatever
23519,0.375,1043,you spend
23520,0.375,974,from
23521,0.375,1424,(any) thing

23525,0.375,1668,it will be fully repaid
23526,0.375,36,to you
23527,0.375,56,and you
23528,0.375,866,(will) not
23529,0.375,1755,be wronged.
23530,0.375694444,47,And if
23531,0.375694444,692,they incline
23532,0.375694444,1481,to peace
23533,0.375694444,692,then you (also) incline
23534,0.375694444,865,to it
23535,0.375694444,1684,and put (your) trust
23536,0.375694444,130,in
23537,0.375694444,25,Allah.
23538,0.375694444,51,Indeed

23797,0.385416667,86,But those of blood relationship
23798,0.385416667,1248,But those of blood relationship
23799,0.385416667,212,some of them

23805,0.385416667,51,Indeed

23807,0.385416667,753,of every
23808,0.385416667,1424,thing
23809,0.385416667,126,(is) All-Knower.
23810,09:01,259,Freedom from obligations
23811,09:01,974,from

23814,09:01,36,to
23815,09:01,29,those (with) whom
23816,09:01,118,you made a
23817,09:01,974,from
23818,09:01,1407,the polytheists.
23819,09:02,1536,So move about
23820,09:02,439,in
23821,09:02,61,the land
23822,09:02,1218,(during) four
23823,09:02,1383,months
23824,09:02,126,but know
23825,09:02,51,that you
23826,09:02,491,(can) not
23827,09:02,124,escape
23828,09:02,25,Allah
23829,09:02,51,and that
23830,09:02,25,Allah
23831,09:02,864,(is) the One Who (will) disgrace
23832,09:02,742,the disbelievers.
23833,09:03,80,And an announcement
23834,09:03,974,from Allah
23835,09:03,25,from Allah
23836,09:03,1283,and His Messenger
23837,09:03,36,to
23838,09:03,1120,the people
23839,09:03,1750,(on the) day
23840,09:03,569,(of) the greater Pilgrimage
23841,09:03,734,(of) the greater Pilgrimage
23842,09:03,51,that
23843,09:03,25,Allah
23844,09:03,259,(is) free from obligations
23845,09:03,974,[of]
23846,09:03,1407,(to) the polytheists
23847,09:03,1283,and (so is) His Messenger.
23848,09:03,47,So if
23849,09:03,1558,you repent
23850,09:03,534,then it is
23851,09:03,861,best
23852,09:03,865,for you.
23853,09:03,47,But if
23854,09:03,1688,you turn away
23855,09:03,126,then know
23856,09:03,51,that you
23857,09:03,491,(can) not
23858,09:03,124,escape
23859,09:03,25,Allah.
23860,09:03,273,And give glad tidings
23861,09:03,29,(to) those who
23862,09:03,742,disbelieve
23863,09:03,184,of a punishment
23864,09:03,30,painful.
23865,09:04,27,Except
23866,09:04,29,those (with) whom
23867,09:04,118,you have a
23868,09:04,974,among
23869,09:04,1407,the polytheists
23870,09:04,1613,then
23871,09:04,900,not
23872,09:04,1084,they have failed you
23873,09:04,1424,(in any) thing
23874,09:04,900,and not
23875,09:04,1753,they have supported
23876,09:04,130,against you
23877,09:04,16,anyone
23878,09:04,1551,so fulfil
23879,09:04,36,to them
23880,09:04,118,their treaty
23881,09:04,36,till
23882,09:04,943,their term.
23883,09:04,51,Indeed
23884,09:04,25,Allah
23885,09:04,551,loves
23886,09:04,1697,the righteous.
23887,09:05,79,Then when
23888,09:05,1479,have passed
23889,09:05,1383,the sacred months
23890,09:05,602,the sacred months
23891,09:05,1193,then kill
23892,09:05,1407,the polytheists
23893,09:05,647,wherever
23894,09:05,1677,you find them
23895,09:05,22,and seize them
23896,09:05,614,and besiege them
23897,09:05,1130,and sit (in wait)
23898,09:05,865,for them
23899,09:05,753,(at) every
23900,09:05,1279,place of ambush.
23901,09:05,47,But if
23902,09:05,1558,they repent
23903,09:05,1206,and establish
23904,09:05,1339,the prayer
23905,09:05,73,and give
23906,09:05,1773,the zakah
23907,09:05,819,then leave
23908,09:05,1439,their way.
23909,09:05,51,Indeed
23910,09:05,25,Allah
23911,09:05,454,(is) Oft-Forgiving
23912,09:05,1248,Most Merciful.
23913,09:06,47,And if
23914,09:06,16,anyone
23915,09:06,974,of
23916,09:06,1407,the polytheists
23917,09:06,716,seek your protection
23918,09:06,716,then grant him protection
23919,09:06,624,until
23920,09:06,1487,he hears
23921,09:06,754,(the) Words of Allah.
23922,09:06,25,(the) Words of Allah.
23923,09:06,1613,Then
23924,09:06,246,escort him
23925,09:06,42,(to) his place of safety.
23926,09:06,1637,That
23927,09:06,51,(is) because they
23928,09:06,1206,(are) a people
23929,09:06,866,(who) do not know.
23930,09:06,126,(who) do not know.
23931,09:07,790,How
23932,09:07,785,can (there) be
23933,09:07,1407,for the polytheists
23934,09:07,118,a covenant
23935,09:07,141,with
23936,09:07,25,Allah
23937,09:07,141,and with
23938,09:07,1283,His Messenger
23939,09:07,27,except
23940,09:07,29,those (with) whom
23941,09:07,118,you made a
23942,09:07,141,near
23943,09:07,1464,Al-Masjid Al-Haraam?
23944,09:07,602,Al-Masjid Al-Haraam?
23945,09:07,933,So long as
23946,09:07,1206,they are upright
23947,09:07,865,to you
23948,09:07,1206,then you be upright
23949,09:07,865,to them.
23950,09:07,51,Indeed
23951,09:07,25,Allah
23952,09:07,551,loves
23953,09:07,1697,the righteous.
23954,09:08,790,How
23955,09:08,47,while if
23956,09:08,1753,they gain dominance
23957,09:08,130,over you
23958,09:08,866,they do not regard (the ties)
23959,09:08,1274,they do not regard (the ties)
23960,09:08,439,with you
23961,09:08,26,(of) kinship
23962,09:08,866,and not
23963,09:08,1639,covenant of protection?
23964,09:08,1226,They satisfy you
23965,09:08,432,with their mouths
23966,09:08,7,but refuse
23967,09:08,1152,their hearts
23968,09:08,780,and most of them
23969,09:08,421,(are) defiantly disobedient.
23970,09:09,1412,They exchange
23971,09:09,90,[with] the Verses of Allah
23972,09:09,25,[with] the Verses of Allah
23973,09:09,1614,(for) a little price
23974,09:09,1154,(for) a little price
23975,09:09,1315,and they hinder (people)
23976,09:09,139,from
23977,09:09,1439,His way.
23978,09:09,51,Indeed
23979,09:09,1523,evil
23980,09:09,933,(is) what
23981,09:09,785,they used to
23982,09:09,133,do.
23983,09:10,866,Not
23984,09:10,1274,they respect (the ties)
23985,09:10,439,towards
23986,09:10,42,a believer
23987,09:10,26,(of) kinship
23988,09:10,866,and not
23989,09:10,1639,covenant of protection.
23990,09:10,87,And those
23991,09:10,516,[they]
23992,09:10,114,(are) the transgressors.
23993,09:11,47,But if
23994,09:11,1558,they repent
23995,09:11,1206,and establish
23996,09:11,1339,the prayer
23997,09:11,73,and give
23998,09:11,1773,the zakah
23999,09:11,23,then (they are) your brothers
24000,09:11,439,in
24001,09:11,371,[the] religion.
24002,09:11,416,And We explain in detail
24003,09:11,90,the Verses
24004,09:11,1206,for a people
24005,09:11,126,(who) know.
24006,09:12,47,And if
24007,09:12,1073,they break
24008,09:12,1737,their oaths
24009,09:12,974,after
24010,09:12,213,after
24011,09:12,118,their treaty
24012,09:12,1564,and defame
24013,09:12,439,[in]
24014,09:12,371,your religion
24015,09:12,1193,then fight
24016,09:12,40,the leaders
24017,09:12,742,(of) [the] disbelief
24018,09:12,51,indeed they -
24019,09:12,866,no
24020,09:12,1737,oaths
24021,09:12,865,for them
24022,09:12,870,so that they may
24023,09:12,1053,cease.
24024,09:13,866,Will not
24025,09:13,1193,you fight
24026,09:13,1206,a people
24027,09:13,1073,who broke
24028,09:13,1737,their oaths
24029,09:13,519,and determined
24030,09:13,830,to drive out
24031,09:13,1283,the Messenger
24032,09:13,516,and they
24033,09:13,219,began (to attack) you
24034,09:13,86,first
24035,09:13,985,time?
24036,09:13,840,Do you fear them?
24037,09:13,25,But Allah
24038,09:13,595,(has) more right
24039,09:13,47,that
24040,09:13,840,you should fear Him
24041,09:13,47,if
24042,09:13,785,you are
24043,09:13,42,believers.
24044,09:14,1193,Fight them -
24045,09:14,184,Allah will punish them
24046,09:14,25,Allah will punish them
24047,09:14,1732,by your hands
24048,09:14,864,and disgrace them
24049,09:14,1089,and give you victory
24050,09:14,130,over them
24051,09:14,1377,and will heal
24052,09:14,1318,(the) breasts
24053,09:14,1206,(of) a people
24054,09:14,42,(who are) believers.
24055,09:15,1632,And remove
24056,09:15,492,(the) anger
24057,09:15,1152,(of) their hearts.
24058,09:15,1558,And Allah accepts repentance
24059,09:15,25,And Allah accepts repentance
24060,09:15,130,of
24061,09:15,974,whom
24062,09:15,1424,He wills.
24063,09:15,25,And Allah
24064,09:15,126,(is) All-Knower
24065,09:15,572,All-Wise.
24066,09:16,37,Or
24067,09:16,617,(do) you think
24068,09:16,47,that
24069,09:16,1556,you would be left
24070,09:16,904,while not
24071,09:16,126,Allah made evident
24072,09:16,25,Allah made evident
24073,09:16,29,those who
24074,09:16,670,strive
24075,09:16,974,among you
24076,09:16,900,and not
24077,09:16,22,take
24078,09:16,974,besides Allah
24079,09:16,369,besides Allah
24080,09:16,25,besides Allah
24081,09:16,866,and not
24082,09:16,1283,His Messenger
24083,09:16,866,and not
24084,09:16,42,the believers
24085,09:16,1687,(as) intimates?
24086,09:16,25,And Allah
24087,09:16,796,(is) All-Aware
24088,09:16,251,of what
24089,09:16,133,you do.
24090,09:17,933,(It) is not
24091,09:17,785,(It) is not
24092,09:17,1407,for the polytheists
24093,09:17,47,that
24094,09:17,137,they maintain
24095,09:17,1464,(the) masajid of Allah
24096,09:17,25,(the) masajid of Allah
24097,09:17,1381,(while) witnessing
24098,09:17,130,against
24099,09:17,1046,themselves
24100,09:17,742,[with] disbelief.
24101,09:17,87,(For) those
24102,09:17,556,worthless
24103,09:17,133,(are) their deeds
24104,09:17,439,and in
24105,09:17,1117,the Fire

25197,0.425694444,88,And their abode

29868,0.534027778,973,as to what
29869,0.534027778,101,worship
29870,0.534027778,87,these (polytheists).
29871,0.534027778,933,Not

29882,0.534027778,491,without

29884,0.534722222,1140,And verily
29885,0.534722222,73,We gave
29886,0.534722222,1009,Musa
29887,0.534722222,777,the Book

29889,0.534722222,439,therein.
29890,0.534722222,919,And if not

29894,0.534722222,1219,your Lord
29895,0.534722222,1139,surely would have been judged
29896,0.534722222,297,between them.
29897,0.534722222,51,And indeed they
29898,0.534722222,439,surely (are) in
29899,0.534722222,1389,doubt
29900,0.534722222,974,concerning it

29904,0.535416667,904,to each [when]
29905,0.535416667,1668,surely will pay them in full

29907,0.535416667,133,their deeds.
29908,0.535416667,51,Indeed He
29909,0.535416667,251,of what
29910,0.535416667,133,they do
29911,0.535416667,796,(is) All-Aware.
29912,0.536111111,1206,So stand firm
29913,0.536111111,757,as
29914,0.536111111,43,you are commanded
29915,0.536111111,974,and (those) who
29916,0.536111111,1558,turn (in repentance)

29919,0.536111111,1571,transgress.
29920,0.536111111,51,Indeed He
29921,0.536111111,251,of what
29922,0.536111111,133,you do
29923,0.536111111,272,(is) All-Seer.
29924,0.536805556,866,And (do) not
29925,0.536805556,1263,incline
29926,0.536805556,36,to
29927,0.536805556,29,those who
29928,0.536805556,1755,do wrong

29938,0.536805556,1613,then
29939,0.536805556,866,not
29940,0.536805556,1089,you will be helped.
29941,0.5375,1206,And establish
29942,0.5375,1339,the prayer
29943,0.5375,1587,(at the) two ends
29944,0.5375,1052,(of) the day
29945,0.5375,1775,and (at) the approach
29946,0.5375,974,of
29947,0.5375,926,the night.
29948,0.5375,51,Indeed
29949,0.5375,620,the good deeds
29950,0.5375,1632,remove
29951,0.5375,1523,the evil deeds.
29952,0.5375,1637,That
29953,0.5375,1634,(is) a reminder
29954,0.5375,1634,for those who remember.
29955,0.538194444,1311,And be patient
29956,0.538194444,51,for indeed
29957,0.538194444,25,Allah
29958,0.538194444,866,(does) not
29959,0.538194444,321,let go waste
29960,0.538194444,19,(the) reward

29980,0.538888889,1542,But followed
29981,0.538888889,29,those who
29982,0.538888889,1755,did wrong
29983,0.538888889,933,what

29985,0.538888889,439,therein

35374,0.724305556,1070,they deny it.
35375,0.724305556,780,And most of them

35430,0.727083333,414,invent.
35431,0.727777778,29,And those who

35494,0.729861111,1140,while verily
35495,0.729861111,655,you have made
35496,0.729861111,25,Allah
35497,0.729861111,130,over you
35498,0.729861111,741,a surety.
35499,0.729861111,51,Indeed
35500,0.729861111,25,Allah
35501,0.729861111,126,knows
35502,0.729861111,933,what
35503,0.729861111,374,you do.
35504,0.730555556,866,And (do) not
35505,0.730555556,785,be
35506,0.730555556,28,like her who
35507,0.730555556,1081,untwists
35508,0.730555556,493,her spun yarn
35509,0.730555556,974,after

35512,0.730555556,1073,(into) untwisted strands;
35513,0.730555556,22,you take
35514,0.730555556,1737,your oaths
35515,0.730555556,342,(as) a deception
35516,0.730555556,297,between you
35517,0.730555556,47,because
35518,0.730555556,785,is
35519,0.730555556,40,a community
35520,0.730555556,539,[it]
35521,0.730555556,1224,more numerous

35524,0.730555556,52,Only
35525,0.730555556,248,Allah tests you

35527,0.730555556,208,by it.
35528,0.730555556,297,And He will make clear

35530,0.730555556,1750,(on) the Day
35531,0.730555556,1206,(of) the Resurrection
35532,0.730555556,933,what
35533,0.730555556,785,you used (to)
35534,0.730555556,439,in it
35535,0.730555556,814,differ.
35536,0.73125,917,And if
35537,0.73125,1424,Allah (had) willed
35538,0.73125,25,Allah (had) willed
35539,0.73125,655,surely He (could) have made you
35540,0.73125,40,a nation
35541,0.73125,1673,one
35542,0.73125,899,but
35543,0.73125,311,He lets go astray
35544,0.73125,974,whom
35545,0.73125,1424,He wills
35546,0.73125,507,and guides
35547,0.73125,974,whom
35548,0.73125,1424,He wills.
35549,0.73125,1429,And surely you will be questioned
35550,0.73125,135,about what
35551,0.73125,785,you used (to)
35552,0.73125,133,do.
35553,0.731944444,866,And (do) not
35554,0.731944444,22,take
35555,0.731944444,1737,your oaths
35556,0.731944444,342,(as) a deception
35557,0.731944444,297,between you
35558,0.731944444,1776,lest should slip
35559,0.731944444,1143,a foot
35560,0.731944444,213,after
35561,0.731944444,1605,it is firmly planted
35562,0.731944444,1648,and you would
35563,0.731944444,1523,the evil

35565,0.731944444,1315,you hindered
35566,0.731944444,139,from
35567,0.731944444,1439,(the) way
35568,0.731944444,25,(of) Allah
35569,0.731944444,865,and for you
35570,0.731944444,184,(is) a punishment
35571,0.731944444,201,great.
35572,0.732638889,866,And (do) not
35573,0.732638889,1412,exchange
35574,0.732638889,118,the covenant
35575,0.732638889,25,(of) Allah
35576,0.732638889,1614,(for) a price
35577,0.732638889,1154,little.
35578,0.732638889,52,Indeed what
35579,0.732638889,141,(is) with
35580,0.732638889,25,Allah
35581,0.732638889,534,it
35582,0.732638889,861,(is) better

35584,0.732638889,47,if
35585,0.732638889,785,you were (to)
35586,0.732638889,126,know.
35587,0.733333333,933,Whatever
35588,0.733333333,141,(is) with you
35589,0.733333333,1039,will be exhausted
35590,0.733333333,933,and whatever
35591,0.733333333,141,(is) with
35592,0.733333333,25,Allah
35593,0.733333333,258,(will) be remaining.
35594,0.733333333,725,And surely We will pay
35595,0.733333333,29,those who
35596,0.733333333,1311,(are) patient
35597,0.733333333,19,their reward
35598,0.733333333,620,to (the) best
35599,0.733333333,933,(of) what
35600,0.733333333,785,they used (to)
35601,0.733333333,133,do.
35602,0.734027778,974,Whoever
35603,0.734027778,133,does
35604,0.734027778,1337,righteous deeds
35605,0.734027778,974,whether
35606,0.734027778,1634,male

35610,0.734027778,42,(is) a believer

43313,22:38,139,defends
43314,22:38,29,those who
43315,22:38,42,believe.
43316,22:38,51,Indeed
43317,22:38,25,Allah
43318,22:38,866,(does) not
43319,22:38,551,like
43320,22:38,753,ever
43321,22:38,855,treacherous
43322,22:38,742,ungrateful.
43323,22:39,80,Permission is given
43324,22:39,29,to those who
43325,22:39,1193,are being fought
43326,22:39,51,because they
43327,22:39,1755,were wronged.
43328,22:39,51,And indeed

43330,22:39,130,for
43331,22:39,1089,their victory
43332,22:39,1144,(is) surely Able.

43360,22:40,1089,And surely Allah will help
43361,22:40,25,And surely Allah will help
43362,22:40,974,(those) who
43363,22:40,1089,help Him.
43364,22:40,51,Indeed
43365,22:40,25,Allah
43366,22:40,1209,(is) surely All-Strong
43367,22:40,207,All-Mighty.
43368,22:41,29,Those who
43369,22:41,47,if
43370,22:41,960,We establish them
43371,22:41,439,in
43372,22:41,61,the land

43375,22:41,73,y give
43376,22:41,1773,and the zakah
43377,22:41,43,and they enjoin
43378,22:41,153,the right
43379,22:41,1053,and forbid
43380,22:41,139,from
43381,22:41,1070,the wrong.
43382,22:41,25,And for Allah
43383,22:41,146,(is the) end
43384,22:41,43,(of) the matters.
43385,22:42,47,And if
43386,22:42,781,they deny you
43387,22:42,1140,so verily
43388,22:42,781,denied
43389,22:42,1134,before them
43390,22:42,1206,(the) people

43399,22:44,945,(of) Madyan.
43400,22:44,781,And Musa was denied
43401,22:44,1009,And Musa was denied
43402,22:44,971,so I granted respite
43403,22:44,742,to the disbelievers
43404,22:44,1613,then
43405,22:44,22,I seized them
43406,22:44,790,and how
43407,22:44,785,was
43408,22:44,1070,My punishment.
43409,22:45,729,And how many

43413,22:45,539,while it
43414,22:45,1755,was doing wrong
43415,22:45,539,so it
43416,22:45,857,fell

43423,22:46,900,So have not
43424,22:46,1539,they traveled
43425,22:46,439,in
43426,22:46,61,the land

43436,22:46,51,For indeed [it]
43437,22:46,866,not
43438,22:46,138,(are) blinded
43439,22:46,272,the eyes

43441,22:46,138,(are) blinded

43444,22:46,439,(are) in

43446,22:47,122,And they ask you to hasten
43447,22:47,184,the punishment.
43448,22:47,907,But never will
43449,22:47,814,Allah fail
43450,22:47,25,Allah fail
43451,22:47,1652,(in) His Promise.
43452,22:47,51,And indeed
43453,22:47,1750,a day
43454,22:47,141,with
43455,22:47,1219,your Lord
43456,22:47,24,(is) like a thousand

43459,22:47,110,you count.

43465,22:48,539,while it
43466,22:48,1755,(was) doing wrong.
43467,22:48,1613,Then
43468,22:48,22,I seized it
43469,22:48,36,and to Me
43470,22:48,1365,(is) the destination.
43471,22:49,1205,Say

43482,22:50,1337,righteous deeds -
43483,22:50,865,for them
43484,22:50,454,(is) forgiveness
43485,22:50,1301,and a provision
43486,22:50,767,noble.
43487,22:51,29,And those who
43488,22:51,1433,strove
43489,22:51,439,against

43501,22:52,866,and not
43502,22:52,1025,a Prophet

43504,22:52,79,when
43505,22:52,978,he recited
43506,22:52,913,threw
43507,22:52,1416,the Shaitaan
43508,22:52,439,in
43509,22:52,978,his recitation.
43510,22:52,1100,But Allah abolishes

43512,22:52,933,what
43513,22:52,913,throws
43514,22:52,1416,the Shaitaan

43518,22:52,90,His Verses.
43519,22:52,25,And Allah
43520,22:52,126,(is) All-Knower
43521,22:52,572,All-Wise.
43522,22:53,655,That He may make

43525,22:53,1416,the Shaitaan throws
43526,22:53,426,a trial

43533,22:53,51,And indeed
43534,22:53,1755,the wrongdoers
43535,22:53,439,(are) surely in
43536,22:53,1401,schism

43586,22:56,1022,(of) Delight.
43587,22:57,29,And those who

43598,22:58,1439,(the) way

43604,22:58,1301,surely Allah will provide them
43605,22:58,25,surely Allah will provide them
43606,22:58,1301,a provision
43607,22:58,620,good.
43608,22:58,51,And indeed
43609,22:58,25,Allah
43610,22:58,534,surely He
43611,22:58,861,(is the) Best
43612,22:58,1301,(of) the Providers.
43613,22:59,342,Surely He will admit them
43614,22:59,342,(to) an entrance
43615,22:59,1226,they will be pleased (with) it.
43616,22:59,51,And indeed

43619,22:59,575,Most Forbearing.
43620,0.958333333,1637,That
43621,0.958333333,974,and whoever
43622,0.958333333,146,has retaliated
43623,0.958333333,1004,with the like

43625,0.958333333,146,he was made to suffer
43626,0.958333333,208,by it
43627,0.958333333,1613,then
43628,0.958333333,228,he was oppressed

43630,0.958333333,1089,Allah will surely help him.
43631,0.958333333,25,Allah will surely help him.
43632,0.958333333,51,Indeed
43633,0.958333333,25,Allah

43661,0.959722222,534,it

44004,23:12,1140,And indeed
44005,23:12,816,We created

44354,23:44,933,Every time
44355,23:44,720,came
44356,23:44,40,(to) a nation
44357,23:44,1283,its Messenger
44358,23:44,781,they denied him
44359,23:44,1542,so We made (them) follow -
44360,23:44,212,some of them
44361,23:44,212,others
44362,23:44,655,and We made them
44363,23:44,562,narrations.
44364,23:44,213,So away
44365,23:44,1206,with a people -
44366,23:44,866,not
44367,23:44,42,they believe.
44368,23:45,1613,Then
44369,23:45,1283,We sent
44370,23:45,1009,Musa
44371,23:45,23,and his brother
44372,23:45,529,Harun
44373,23:45,90,with Our Signs
44374,23:45,1485,and an authority
44375,23:45,297,clear
44376,23:46,36,To
44377,23:46,400,Firaun
44378,23:46,966,and his chiefs
44379,23:46,734,but they behaved arrogantly
44380,23:46,785,and they were
44381,23:46,1206,a people
44382,23:46,129,haughty.
44383,23:47,1205,Then they said
44384,23:47,42,"""Shall we believe"
44385,23:47,273,(in) two men
44386,23:47,1004,like ourselves
44387,23:47,1206,while their people
44388,23:47,865,for us
44389,23:47,101,"(are) slaves."""
44390,23:48,781,So they denied them
44391,23:48,785,and they became
44392,23:48,974,of
44393,23:48,513,those who were destroyed.
44394,23:49,1140,And verily
44395,23:49,73,We gave
44396,23:49,1009,Musa
44397,23:49,777,the Scripture
44398,23:49,870,so that they may
44399,23:49,507,be guided.
44400,23:50,655,And We made
44401,23:50,254,(the) son
44402,23:50,989,(of) Maryam
44403,23:50,40,and his mother
44404,23:50,90,a Sign
44405,23:50,88,and We sheltered them
44406,23:50,36,to
44407,23:50,1224,a high ground
44408,23:50,1646,of tranquility
44409,23:50,1176,of tranquility
44410,23:50,196,and water springs.
44411,23:51,96,O Messengers!
44412,23:51,1283,O Messengers!
44413,23:51,20,Eat

44417,23:51,1337,righteous (deeds).
44418,23:51,51,Indeed I Am

44420,23:51,133,you do
44421,23:51,126,All-Knower.
44422,23:52,51,And indeed
44423,23:52,500,this
44424,23:52,40,your religion
44425,23:52,40,(is) religion
44426,23:52,1673,one.

44428,23:52,1219,your Lord
44429,23:52,1697,so fear Me.
44430,23:53,1196,But they cut off
44431,23:53,43,their affair (of unity)
44432,23:53,297,between them
44433,23:53,1761,(into) sects

44437,23:53,879,they have

44447,23:55,208,[with it]

45392,24:27:00,96,O you
45393,24:27:00,29,who

52140,30:06:00,1652,(It is the) Promise
52141,30:06:00,25,(of) Allah.
52142,30:06:00,866,(Does) not
52143,30:06:00,814,fail
52144,30:06:00,25,Allah
52145,30:06:00,1652,(in) His promise
52146,30:06:00,899,but
52147,30:06:00,780,most (of)
52148,30:06:00,1120,[the] people
52149,30:06:00,866,(do) not
52150,30:06:00,126,know.
52151,30:07:00,126,They know
52152,30:07:00,1753,(the) apparent
52153,30:07:00,974,of
52154,30:07:00,648,the life
52155,30:07:00,354,(of) the world
52156,30:07:00,516,but they
52157,30:07:00,139,about
52158,30:07:00,21,the Hereafter
52159,30:07:00,516,[they]
52160,30:07:00,453,(are) heedless.
52161,30:08:00,900,Do not
52162,30:08:00,387,they ponder
52163,30:08:00,439,within
52164,30:08:00,1046,themselves?
52165,30:08:00,933,Not
52166,30:08:00,816,Allah (has) created
52167,30:08:00,25,Allah (has) created
52168,30:08:00,1493,the heavens
52169,30:08:00,61,and the earth
52170,30:08:00,933,and what
52171,30:08:00,297,(is) between them
52172,30:08:00,27,except
52173,30:08:00,595,in truth
52174,30:08:00,18,and (for) a term
52175,30:08:00,1493,appointed.
52176,30:08:00,51,And indeed
52177,30:08:00,780,many
52178,30:08:00,974,of
52179,30:08:00,1120,the people
52180,30:08:00,913,in (the) meeting
52181,30:08:00,1219,(with) their Lord
52182,30:08:00,742,surely (are) disbelievers.
52183,30:09:00,900,Have not
52184,30:09:00,1539,they traveled
52185,30:09:00,439,in
52186,30:09:00,61,the earth
52187,30:09:00,1124,and observed
52188,30:09:00,790,how
52189,30:09:00,785,was
52190,30:09:00,146,(the) end
52191,30:09:00,29,(of) those
52192,30:09:00,974,before them?
52193,30:09:00,1134,before them?
52194,30:09:00,785,They were
52195,30:09:00,1373,mightier
52196,30:09:00,974,than them
52197,30:09:00,1209,(in) strength
52198,30:09:00,1623,and they dug
52199,30:09:00,61,the earth
52200,30:09:00,137,and built (on) it
52201,30:09:00,780,more
52202,30:09:00,973,than what
52203,30:09:00,137,they have built (on) it.
52204,30:09:00,720,And came (to) them
52205,30:09:00,1283,their Messengers
52206,30:09:00,297,with clear proofs.
52207,30:09:00,933,So not
52208,30:09:00,785,was
52209,30:09:00,25,Allah
52210,30:09:00,1755,to wrong them
52211,30:09:00,899,but
52212,30:09:00,785,they were
52213,30:09:00,1046,themselves
52214,30:09:00,1755,(doing) wrong.
52215,30:10:00,1613,Then
52216,30:10:00,785,was
52217,30:10:00,146,(the) end
52218,30:10:00,29,(of) those who
52219,30:10:00,1523,did evil -
52220,30:10:00,1523,the evil
52221,30:10:00,47,because
52222,30:10:00,781,they denied
52223,30:10:00,90,(the) Signs
52224,30:10:00,25,(of) Allah
52225,30:10:00,785,and were
52226,30:10:00,208,of them
52227,30:10:00,547,making mockery.
52228,30:11:00,25,Allah
52229,30:11:00,219,originates
52230,30:11:00,816,the creation
52231,30:11:00,1613,then
52232,30:11:00,186,He repeats it
52233,30:11:00,1613,then
52234,30:11:00,36,to Him
52235,30:11:00,1250,you will be returned.
52236,30:12:00,1750,And (the) Day
52237,30:12:00,1206,will (be) established
52238,30:12:00,1524,the Hour
52239,30:12:00,247,will (be in) despair
52240,30:12:00,699,the criminals.
52241,30:13:00,900,And not
52242,30:13:00,785,will be
52243,30:13:00,865,for them
52244,30:13:00,974,among
52245,30:13:00,1407,theirs partners
52246,30:13:00,1374,any intercessors
52247,30:13:00,785,and they will be
52248,30:13:00,1407,in their partners
52249,30:13:00,742,disbelievers.
52250,30:14:00,1750,And (the) Day
52251,30:14:00,1206,will (be) established
52252,30:14:00,1524,the Hour
52253,30:14:00,1750,that Day
52254,30:14:00,408,they will become separated.
52255,30:15:00,41,Then as for
52256,30:15:00,29,those who
52257,30:15:00,42,believed
52258,30:15:00,133,and did
52259,30:15:00,1337,righteous deeds
52260,30:15:00,516,so they
52261,30:15:00,439,in
52262,30:15:00,1292,a Garden
52263,30:15:00,554,will be delighted.
52264,30:16:00,41,But as for
52265,30:16:00,29,those who
52266,30:16:00,742,disbelieved
52267,30:16:00,781,and denied
52268,30:16:00,90,Our Signs
52269,30:16:00,913,and (the) meeting
52270,30:16:00,21,(of) the Hereafter
52271,30:16:00,87,then those
52272,30:16:00,439,in
52273,30:16:00,184,the punishment
52274,30:16:00,558,(will be) brought forth.
52275,30:17:00,1438,So glory be to
52276,30:17:00,25,Allah
52277,30:17:00,643,when
52278,30:17:00,998,you reach the evening
52279,30:17:00,643,and when
52280,30:17:00,1310,you reach the morning.
52281,30:18:00,865,And for Him
52282,30:18:00,581,(are) all praises
52283,30:18:00,439,in
52284,30:18:00,1493,the heavens
52285,30:18:00,61,and the earth
52286,30:18:00,168,and (at) night
52287,30:18:00,643,and when
52288,30:18:00,1753,you are at noon.
52289,30:19:00,830,He brings forth
52290,30:19:00,648,the living
52291,30:19:00,974,from
52292,30:19:00,1010,the dead
52293,30:19:00,830,and He brings forth
52294,30:19:00,1010,the dead
52295,30:19:00,974,from
52296,30:19:00,648,the living
52297,30:19:00,648,and He gives life
52298,30:19:00,61,(to) the earth
52299,30:19:00,213,after
52300,30:19:00,1010,its death
52301,30:19:00,1637,and thus
52302,30:19:00,830,you will be brought forth.
52303,30:20:00,974,And among
52304,30:20:00,90,His Signs
52305,30:20:00,47,(is) that
52306,30:20:00,816,He created you
52307,30:20:00,974,from
52308,30:20:00,1554,dust
52309,30:20:00,1613,then
52310,30:20:00,79,behold!
52311,30:20:00,56,You
52312,30:20:00,273,(are) human beings
52313,30:20:00,1093,dispersing.
52314,30:21:00,974,And among

52321,30:21:00,1792,mates
52322,30:21:00,1470,that you may find tranquility

52405,30:26:00,1164,(are) obedient.
52406,30:27:00,534,And He
52407,30:27:00,29,(is) the One Who

52443,30:28:00,853,you fear them
52444,30:28:00,853,as you fear
52445,30:28:00,1046,yourselves?
52446,30:28:00,1637,Thus
52447,30:28:00,416,We explain
52448,30:28:00,90,the Verses

52455,30:29:00,538,their desires
52456,30:29:00,491,without
52457,30:29:00,126,knowledge.
52458,30:29:00,974,Then who

52460,30:29:00,974,(one) whom
52461,30:29:00,311,Allah has let go astray?
52462,30:29:00,25,Allah has let go astray?
52463,30:29:00,933,And not

52516,30:33:00,36,to Him.
52517,30:33:00,1613,Then
52518,30:33:00,79,when
52519,30:33:00,1648,He causes them to taste

52726,30:47:00,29,those who
52727,30:47:00,699,committed crimes.

52738,30:48:00,1459,(the) clouds
52739,30:48:00,279,then He spreads them
52740,30:48:00,439,in
52741,30:48:00,1493,the sky

52745,30:48:00,774,fragments
52746,30:48:00,1214,so you see
52747,30:48:00,1662,the rain

52754,30:48:00,974,whom
52755,30:48:00,1424,He wills

52759,30:48:00,516,They
52760,30:48:00,273,rejoice.
52761,30:49:00,47,And certainly
52762,30:49:00,785,they were
52763,30:49:00,974,before

52769,30:49:00,1134,[before it]
52770,30:49:00,247,surely in despair.
52771,30:50:00,1124,So look
52772,30:50:00,36,at
52773,30:50:00,76,(the) effects
52774,30:50:00,1248,(of the) Mercy
52775,30:50:00,25,(of) Allah
52776,30:50:00,790,how
52777,30:50:00,648,He gives life
52778,30:50:00,61,(to) the earth
52779,30:50:00,213,after
52780,30:50:00,1010,its death.
52781,30:50:00,51,Indeed
52782,30:50:00,1637,that
52783,30:50:00,648,surely He (will) give life
52784,30:50:00,1010,(to) the dead.
52785,30:50:00,534,And He
52786,30:50:00,130,(is) on
52787,30:50:00,753,every

52789,30:50:00,1144,All-Powerful.
52790,30:51:00,868,But if
52791,30:51:00,1283,We sent
52792,30:51:00,1295,a wind
52793,30:51:00,1214,and they see it
52794,30:51:00,1324,turn yellow
52795,30:51:00,1754,certainly they continue
52796,30:51:00,974,after it

56120,35:05:00,473,deceive you
56121,35:05:00,25,about Allah
56122,35:05:00,473,the Deceiver.
56123,35:06:00,51,Indeed
56124,35:06:00,1416,the Shaitaan
56125,35:06:00,865,(is) to you
56126,35:06:00,114,an enemy
56127,35:06:00,22,so take him
56128,35:06:00,114,(as) an enemy.
56129,35:06:00,52,Only
56130,35:06:00,327,he invites
56131,35:06:00,652,his party
56132,35:06:00,785,that they may be
56133,35:06:00,974,among
56134,35:06:00,1330,(the) companions
56135,35:06:00,1432,(of) the Blaze.
56136,35:07:00,29,Those who
56137,35:07:00,742,disbelieve
56138,35:07:00,865,for them
56139,35:07:00,184,(will be) a punishment
56140,35:07:00,1373,severe
56141,35:07:00,29,and those
56142,35:07:00,42,who believe
56143,35:07:00,133,and do
56144,35:07:00,1337,righteous deeds
56145,35:07:00,865,for them
56146,35:07:00,454,(will be) forgiveness
56147,35:07:00,19,and a reward
56148,35:07:00,734,great.
56149,35:08:00,974,Then is (he) who -
56150,35:08:00,1798,is made fair-seeming
56151,35:08:00,865,to him
56152,35:08:00,1523,(the) evil
56153,35:08:00,133,(of) his deed -
56154,35:08:00,1214,so that he sees it
56155,35:08:00,620,(as) good?
56156,35:08:00,51,For indeed
56157,35:08:00,25,Allah
56158,35:08:00,311,lets go astray
56159,35:08:00,974,whom
56160,35:08:00,1424,He wills
56161,35:08:00,507,and guides
56162,35:08:00,974,whom
56163,35:08:00,1424,He wills.
56164,35:08:00,866,So (let) not
56165,35:08:00,1632,go out
56166,35:08:00,1046,your soul
56167,35:08:00,130,for them
56168,35:08:00,621,(in) regrets.
56169,35:08:00,51,Indeed
56170,35:08:00,25,Allah
56171,35:08:00,126,(is) All-Knower
56172,35:08:00,251,of what
56173,35:08:00,1345,they do.
56174,35:09:00,25,And Allah
56175,35:09:00,29,(is) the One Who
56176,35:09:00,1283,sends
56177,35:09:00,1295,the winds
56178,35:09:00,1623,so that they raise
56179,35:09:00,1459,(the) clouds
56180,35:09:00,1531,and We drive them
56181,35:09:00,36,to
56182,35:09:00,245,a land
56183,35:09:00,1010,dead
56184,35:09:00,648,and We revive
56185,35:09:00,208,therewith
56186,35:09:00,61,the earth
56187,35:09:00,213,after
56188,35:09:00,1010,its death.
56189,35:09:00,1637,Thus
56190,35:09:00,1093,(will be) the Resurrection.
56191,35:10:00,974,Whoever
56192,35:10:00,785,[is] desires
56193,35:10:00,1293,[is] desires
56194,35:10:00,207,the honor
56195,35:10:00,25,then for Allah
56196,35:10:00,207,(is) the Honor
56197,35:10:00,683,all.
56198,35:10:00,36,To Him
56199,35:10:00,1303,ascends
56200,35:10:00,754,the words
56201,35:10:00,1600,good
56202,35:10:00,133,and the deed
56203,35:10:00,1337,righteous
56204,35:10:00,1232,raises it.
56205,35:10:00,29,But those who
56206,35:10:00,961,plot
56207,35:10:00,1523,the evil
56208,35:10:00,865,for them
56209,35:10:00,184,(is) a punishment
56210,35:10:00,1373,severe
56211,35:10:00,961,and (the) plotting
56212,35:10:00,87,(of) those -
56213,35:10:00,534,it
56214,35:10:00,293,(will) perish.
56215,35:11:00,25,And Allah
56216,35:11:00,816,created you
56217,35:11:00,974,from
56218,35:11:00,1554,dust
56219,35:11:00,1613,then
56220,35:11:00,974,from
56221,35:11:00,1106,a semen-drop;
56222,35:11:00,1613,then
56223,35:11:00,655,He made you
56224,35:11:00,1792,pairs.
56225,35:11:00,933,And not
56226,35:11:00,582,conceives
56227,35:11:00,974,any
56228,35:11:00,57,female
56229,35:11:00,866,and not
56230,35:11:00,1658,gives birth
56231,35:11:00,27,except
56232,35:11:00,126,with His knowledge.
56233,35:11:00,933,And not
56234,35:11:00,137,is granted life
56235,35:11:00,974,any
56236,35:11:00,137,aged person
56237,35:11:00,866,and not
56238,35:11:00,1084,is lessened
56239,35:11:00,974,from
56240,35:11:00,137,his life
56241,35:11:00,27,but
56242,35:11:00,439,(is) in
56243,35:11:00,777,a Register.
56244,35:11:00,51,Indeed
56245,35:11:00,1637,that
56246,35:11:00,130,for
56247,35:11:00,25,Allah
56248,35:11:00,1747,(is) easy.
56249,35:12:00,933,And not
56250,35:12:00,1534,are alike
56251,35:12:00,233,the two seas.
56252,35:12:00,500,This
56253,35:12:00,184,(is) fresh
56254,35:12:00,411,sweet
56255,35:12:00,1527,pleasant
56256,35:12:00,1404,its drink
56257,35:12:00,500,and this
56258,35:12:00,967,salty
56259,35:12:00,17,(and) bitter.
56260,35:12:00,974,And from
56261,35:12:00,753,each
56262,35:12:00,20,you eat
56263,35:12:00,893,meat
56264,35:12:00,1590,fresh
56265,35:12:00,830,and you extract
56266,35:12:00,578,ornaments
56267,35:12:00,875,you wear them
56268,35:12:00,1214,and you see
56269,35:12:00,390,the ships
56270,35:12:00,439,in it
56271,35:12:00,965,cleaving
56272,35:12:00,228,so that you may seek
56273,35:12:00,974,of
56274,35:12:00,377,His Bounty
56275,35:12:00,870,and that you may
56276,35:12:00,1391,be grateful.
56277,35:13:00,1687,He causes to enter
56278,35:13:00,926,the night
56279,35:13:00,439,in (to)
56280,35:13:00,1052,the day
56281,35:13:00,1687,and He causes to enter
56282,35:13:00,1052,the day
56283,35:13:00,439,in (to)
56284,35:13:00,926,the night
56285,35:13:00,1473,and He has subjected
56286,35:13:00,1397,the sun
56287,35:13:00,1160,and the moon
56288,35:13:00,753,each
56289,35:13:00,701,running
56290,35:13:00,18,for a term
56291,35:13:00,1493,appointed.
56292,35:13:00,1637,That (is)
56293,35:13:00,25,Allah
56294,35:13:00,1219,your Lord
56295,35:13:00,865,for Him
56296,35:13:00,968,(is) the Dominion.
56297,35:13:00,29,And those whom
56298,35:13:00,327,you invoke
56299,35:13:00,974,besides Him
56300,35:13:00,369,besides Him
56301,35:13:00,933,not
56302,35:13:00,968,they possess
56303,35:13:00,974,even
56304,35:13:00,1198,(as much as) the membrane of a date-seed.
56305,35:14:00,47,If
56306,35:14:00,327,you invoke them
56307,35:14:00,866,not
56308,35:14:00,1487,they hear
56309,35:14:00,327,your call;
56310,35:14:00,917,and if
56311,35:14:00,1487,they heard
56312,35:14:00,933,not
56313,35:14:00,713,they (would) respond
56314,35:14:00,865,to you.
56315,35:14:00,1750,And (on the) Day
56316,35:14:00,1206,(of) the Resurrection
56317,35:14:00,742,they will deny
56318,35:14:00,1407,your association.
56319,35:14:00,866,And none
56320,35:14:00,1025,can inform you
56321,35:14:00,1004,like
56322,35:14:00,796,(the) All-Aware.
56323,35:15:00,96,O
56324,35:15:00,1120,mankind!
56325,35:15:00,56,You
56326,35:15:00,399,(are) those in need
56327,35:15:00,36,of
56328,35:15:00,25,Allah
56329,35:15:00,25,while Allah
56330,35:15:00,534,He
56331,35:15:00,468,(is) Free of need
56332,35:15:00,581,the Praiseworthy.
56333,35:16:00,47,If
56334,35:16:00,1424,He wills
56335,35:16:00,1632,He (can) do away with you
56336,35:16:00,73,and bring
56337,35:16:00,816,in a creation
56338,35:16:00,663,new.
56339,35:17:00,933,And not
56340,35:17:00,1637,that
56341,35:17:00,130,(is) on
56342,35:17:00,25,Allah
56343,35:17:00,207,difficult.
56344,35:18:00,866,And not
56345,35:18:00,1728,will bear
56346,35:18:00,1728,bearer of burdens
56347,35:18:00,1728,burden
56348,35:18:00,21,(of) another.
56349,35:18:00,47,And if
56350,35:18:00,327,calls
56351,35:18:00,1619,a heavily laden
56352,35:18:00,36,to
56353,35:18:00,582,(carry) its load
56354,35:18:00,866,not
56355,35:18:00,582,will be carried
56356,35:18:00,974,of it
56357,35:18:00,1424,anything
56358,35:18:00,917,even if
56359,35:18:00,785,he be
56360,35:18:00,1646,near of kin.
56361,35:18:00,1170,near of kin.
56362,35:18:00,52,Only
56363,35:18:00,1110,you can warn
56364,35:18:00,29,those who
56365,35:18:00,840,fear
56366,35:18:00,1219,their Lord -
56367,35:18:00,489,unseen
56368,35:18:00,1206,and establish
56369,35:18:00,1339,the prayer.
56370,35:18:00,974,And whoever
56371,35:18:00,1773,purifies himself
56372,35:18:00,52,then only
56373,35:18:00,1773,he purifies
56374,35:18:00,1046,for his own self.
56375,35:18:00,36,And to
56376,35:18:00,25,Allah
56377,35:18:00,1365,(is) the destination.
56378,35:19:00,933,And not
56379,35:19:00,1534,equal
56380,35:19:00,138,(are) the blind
56381,35:19:00,272,and the seeing
56382,35:20:00,866,And not
56383,35:20:00,1755,the darkness[es]
56384,35:20:00,866,and not
56385,35:20:00,1117,[the] light
56386,35:21:00,866,And not
56387,35:21:00,1754,the shade
56388,35:21:00,866,and not
56389,35:21:00,604,the heat
56390,35:22:00,933,And not
56391,35:22:00,1534,equal
56392,35:22:00,648,(are) the living
56393,35:22:00,866,and not
56394,35:22:00,1010,the dead.
56395,35:22:00,51,Indeed
56396,35:22:00,25,Allah
56397,35:22:00,1487,causes to hear
56398,35:22:00,974,whom
56399,35:22:00,1424,He wills
56400,35:22:00,933,and not
56401,35:22:00,55,you
56402,35:22:00,1487,can make hear
56403,35:22:00,974,(those) who
56404,35:22:00,439,(are) in
56405,35:22:00,1135,the graves.
56406,35:23:00,47,Not
56407,35:23:00,55,you (are)
56408,35:23:00,27,but
56409,35:23:00,1110,a warner.
56410,35:24:00,51,Indeed We
56411,35:24:00,1283,[We] have sent you
56412,35:24:00,595,with the truth
56413,35:24:00,273,(as) a bearer of glad tidings
56414,35:24:00,1110,and (as) a warner.
56415,35:24:00,47,And not
56416,35:24:00,974,(was) any
56417,35:24:00,40,nation
56418,35:24:00,27,but
56419,35:24:00,819,had passed
56420,35:24:00,439,within it
56421,35:24:00,1110,a warner.
56422,35:25:00,47,And if
56423,35:25:00,781,they deny you
56424,35:25:00,1140,then certainly
56425,35:25:00,781,denied
56426,35:25:00,29,those who
56427,35:25:00,974,(were) before them.
56428,35:25:00,1134,(were) before them.
56429,35:25:00,720,Came to them
56430,35:25:00,1283,their Messengers
56431,35:25:00,297,with clear signs
56432,35:25:00,1761,and with Scriptures
56433,35:25:00,777,and with the Book
56434,35:25:00,1117,[the] enlightening.
56435,35:26:00,1613,Then
56436,35:26:00,22,I seized
56437,35:26:00,29,those who
56438,35:26:00,742,disbelieved
56439,35:26:00,790,and how
56440,35:26:00,785,was
56441,35:26:00,1070,My rejection!
56442,35:27:00,900,Do not
56443,35:27:00,1214,you see
56444,35:27:00,51,that
56445,35:27:00,25,Allah
56446,35:27:00,1128,sends down
56447,35:27:00,974,from

56780,35:44:00,51,Indeed He
56781,35:44:00,785,is
56782,35:44:00,126,All-Knower

56820,36:04:00,1355,a Path
56821,36:04:00,1206,Straight.
56822,36:05:00,1128,A revelation

56829,36:06:00,6,their forefathers
56830,36:06:00,516,so they
56831,36:06:00,453,(are) heedless.
56832,36:07:00,1140,Certainly
56833,36:07:00,595,(has) proved true

56838,36:07:00,866,(do) not
56839,36:07:00,42,believe.
56840,36:08:00,51,Indeed We
56841,36:08:00,655,[We] have placed
56842,36:08:00,439,on
56843,36:08:00,143,their necks
56844,36:08:00,457,iron collars

56853,36:09:00,1732,before them

56856,36:09:00,814,and behind them
56857,36:09:00,1443,a barrier.
56858,36:09:00,477,and We covered them
56859,36:09:00,516,so they
56860,36:09:00,866,(do) not
56861,36:09:00,272,see.
56862,36:10:00,1534,And it (is) same
56863,36:10:00,130,to them
56864,36:10:00,1110,whether you warn them
56865,36:10:00,37,or
56866,36:10:00,900,(do) not
56867,36:10:00,1110,warn them
56868,36:10:00,866,not
56869,36:10:00,42,they will believe.
56870,36:11:00,52,Only
56871,36:11:00,1110,you (can) warn
56872,36:11:00,974,(him) who
56873,36:11:00,1542,follows
56874,36:11:00,1634,the Reminder

56877,36:11:00,489,in the unseen.
56878,36:11:00,273,So give him glad tidings
56879,36:11:00,454,of forgiveness
56880,36:11:00,19,and a reward
56881,36:11:00,767,noble.
56882,36:12:00,51,Indeed We
56883,36:12:00,1056,[We]
56884,36:12:00,648,[We]give life
56885,36:12:00,1010,(to) the dead

62858,42:30:00,780,much.
62859,42:31:00,933,And not

62861,42:31:00,124,(can) escape

62867,42:31:00,369,besides
62868,42:31:00,25,Allah

62873,42:32:00,974,And among
62874,42:32:00,90,His Signs
62875,42:32:00,701,(are) the ships
62876,42:32:00,439,in
62877,42:32:00,233,the sea
62878,42:32:00,126,like [the] mountains.
62879,42:33:00,47,If
62880,42:33:00,1424,He wills
62881,42:33:00,1470,He can cause the wind to become still
62882,42:33:00,1295,He can cause the wind to become still
62883,42:33:00,1754,then they would remain
62884,42:33:00,1261,motionless
62885,42:33:00,130,on
62886,42:33:00,1753,its back.
62887,42:33:00,51,Indeed
62888,42:33:00,439,in
62889,42:33:00,1637,that
62890,42:33:00,90,surely (are) Signs

62892,42:33:00,1311,patient
62893,42:33:00,1391,(and) grateful.
62894,42:34:00,82,Or
62895,42:34:00,1656,He could destroy them
62896,42:34:00,251,for what
62897,42:34:00,772,they have earned;
62898,42:34:00,117,but He pardons
62899,42:34:00,139,[from]
62900,42:34:00,780,much.
62901,42:35:00,126,And may know
62902,42:35:00,29,those who
62903,42:35:00,664,dispute
62904,42:35:00,439,concerning

62908,42:35:00,974,any
62909,42:35:00,646,place of refuge.
62910,42:36:00,933,So whatever
62911,42:36:00,73,you are given
62912,42:36:00,974,of
62913,42:36:00,1424,a thing
62914,42:36:00,999,(is) but a passing enjoyment
62915,42:36:00,648,(for) the life
62916,42:36:00,354,(of) the world.
62917,42:36:00,933,But what
62918,42:36:00,141,(is) with
62919,42:36:00,25,Allah
62920,42:36:00,861,(is) better
62921,42:36:00,258,and more lasting
62922,42:36:00,29,for those who
62923,42:36:00,42,believe
62924,42:36:00,130,and upon

62939,42:38:00,1219,to their Lord
62940,42:38:00,1206,and establish
62941,42:38:00,1339,prayer
62942,42:38:00,43,and their affairs
62943,42:38:00,1421,(are conducted by) consultation
62944,42:38:00,297,among them
62945,42:38:00,973,and from what
62946,42:38:00,1301,We have provided them
62947,42:38:00,1043,they spend
62948,42:39:00,29,And those who
62949,42:39:00,79,when
62950,42:39:00,1357,strikes them
62951,42:39:00,228,tyranny
62952,42:39:00,516,they
62953,42:39:00,1089,defend themselves.
62954,42:40:00,725,(The) recompense
62955,42:40:00,1523,(of) an evil
62956,42:40:00,1523,(is) an evil
62957,42:40:00,1004,like it.
62958,42:40:00,974,But whoever
62959,42:40:00,117,pardons
62960,42:40:00,1337,and makes reconciliation
62961,42:40:00,19,then his reward
62962,42:40:00,130,(is) on
62963,42:40:00,25,Allah.
62964,42:40:00,51,Indeed He
62965,42:40:00,866,(does) not
62966,42:40:00,551,like
62967,42:40:00,1755,the wrongdoers.
62968,42:41:00,974,And surely whosoever
62969,42:41:00,1089,defends himself
62970,42:41:00,213,after
62971,42:41:00,1755,he has been wronged

62990,42:42:00,184,(is) a punishment
62991,42:42:00,30,painful.

62994,42:43:00,454,and forgives
62995,42:43:00,51,indeed
62996,42:43:00,1637,that
62997,42:43:00,974,(is) surely of

63561,43:36:00,1175,a companion.
63562,43:37:00,51,And indeed they

63604,43:41:00,974,from them
63605,43:41:00,1082,(will) take retribution.
63606,43:42:00,82,Or
63607,43:42:00,1214,We show you

63611,43:42:00,130,over them
63612,43:42:00,1144,have full power.

65542,47:02:00,1128,is revealed

65553,47:02:00,292,their condition.
65554,47:03:00,1637,That

65572,47:04:00,79,So when
65573,47:04:00,913,you meet
65574,47:04:00,29,those who
65575,47:04:00,742,disbelieve
65576,47:04:00,317,then strike
65577,47:04:00,1274,the necks
65578,47:04:00,624,until
65579,47:04:00,79,when
65580,47:04:00,1609,you have subdued

65586,47:04:00,41,or
65587,47:04:00,379,ransom

65589,47:04:00,1658,lays down
65590,47:04:00,596,the war
65591,47:04:00,1728,its burdens.
65592,47:04:00,1637,That.
65593,47:04:00,917,And if
65594,47:04:00,1424,Allah had willed
65595,47:04:00,25,Allah had willed
65596,47:04:00,1089,surely He could have taken retribution
65597,47:04:00,974,from them
65598,47:04:00,899,but
65599,47:04:00,248,to test
65600,47:04:00,212,some of you
65601,47:04:00,212,with others.
65602,47:04:00,29,And those who
65603,47:04:00,1193,are killed
65604,47:04:00,439,in
65605,47:04:00,1439,(the) way of Allah
65606,47:04:00,25,(the) way of Allah
65607,47:04:00,907,then never
65608,47:04:00,311,He will cause to be lost
65609,47:04:00,133,their deeds.
65610,47:05:00,507,He will guide them
65611,47:05:00,1337,and improve
65612,47:05:00,292,their condition
65613,47:06:00,342,And admit them
65614,47:06:00,693,(to) Paradise
65615,47:06:00,153,He has made it known
65616,47:06:00,865,to them.
65617,47:07:00,96,O you who believe!
65618,47:07:00,29,O you who believe!
65619,47:07:00,42,O you who believe!
65620,47:07:00,47,If
65621,47:07:00,1089,you help
65622,47:07:00,25,Allah
65623,47:07:00,1089,He will help you
65624,47:07:00,1605,and make firm
65625,47:07:00,1143,your feet.
65626,47:08:00,29,But those who
65627,47:08:00,742,disbelieve
65628,47:08:00,1541,destruction (is)
65629,47:08:00,865,for them
65630,47:08:00,311,and He will cause to be lost
65631,47:08:00,133,their deeds.
65632,47:09:00,1637,That
65633,47:09:00,51,(is) because they
65634,47:09:00,766,hate
65635,47:09:00,933,what
65636,47:09:00,1128,Allah has revealed
65637,47:09:00,25,Allah has revealed
65638,47:09:00,556,so He has made worthless
65639,47:09:00,133,their deeds.
65640,47:10:00,900,Do not
65641,47:10:00,1539,they travel
65642,47:10:00,439,in

65654,47:10:00,742,and for the disbelievers
65655,47:10:00,1004,its likeness.
65656,47:11:00,1637,That
65657,47:11:00,51,(is) because
65658,47:11:00,25,Allah
65659,47:11:00,1688,(is the) Protector

65667,47:12:00,51,Indeed
65668,47:12:00,25,Allah
65669,47:12:00,342,will admit

65682,47:12:00,20,and eat

65699,47:13:00,513,We destroyed them

65854,47:21:00,25,(to) Allah
65855,47:21:00,785,surely it would have been
65856,47:21:00,861,better
65857,47:21:00,865,for them.
65858,47:22:00,511,Then would
65859,47:22:00,173,you perhaps
65860,47:22:00,47,if
65861,47:22:00,1688,you are given
65862,47:22:00,47,that
65863,47:22:00,419,you cause corruption
65864,47:22:00,439,in
65865,47:22:00,61,the earth
65866,47:22:00,1196,and cut off
65867,47:22:00,1248,your ties of kinship.
65868,47:23:00,87,Those
65869,47:23:00,29,(are) the ones
65870,47:23:00,871,Allah has cursed them
65871,47:23:00,25,Allah has cursed them
65872,47:23:00,1343,so He made them deaf
65873,47:23:00,138,and blinded
65874,47:23:00,272,their vision.
65875,47:24:00,866,Then do not
65876,47:24:00,329,they ponder
65877,47:24:00,1168,(over) the Quran
65878,47:24:00,37,or
65879,47:24:00,130,upon
65880,47:24:00,1152,(their) hearts
65881,47:24:00,1147,(are) locks?
65882,47:25:00,51,Indeed
65883,47:25:00,29,those who
65884,47:25:00,1228,return
65885,47:25:00,130,on
65886,47:25:00,329,their backs
65887,47:25:00,974,after
65888,47:25:00,213,after
65889,47:25:00,933,what
65890,47:25:00,297,(has) become clear
65891,47:25:00,865,to them
65892,47:25:00,507,(of) the guidance
65893,47:25:00,1416,Shaitaan
65894,47:25:00,1529,enticed
65895,47:25:00,865,[for] them
65896,47:25:00,971,and prolonged hope
65897,47:25:00,865,for them.
65898,47:26:00,1637,That
65899,47:26:00,51,(is) because they
65900,47:26:00,1205,[they] said
65901,47:26:00,29,to those who
65902,47:26:00,766,hate
65903,47:26:00,933,what
65904,47:26:00,1128,Allah has revealed
65905,47:26:00,25,Allah has revealed
65906,47:26:00,1593,"""We will obey you"
65907,47:26:00,439,in
65908,47:26:00,212,part
65909,47:26:00,43,"(of) the matter."""
65910,47:26:00,25,But Allah
65911,47:26:00,126,knows
65912,47:26:00,1516,their secrets.
65913,47:27:00,790,Then how
65914,47:27:00,79,when
65915,47:27:00,1668,take them in death
65916,47:27:00,968,the Angels
65917,47:27:00,317,striking
65918,47:27:00,1679,their faces
65919,47:27:00,329,and their backs?
65920,47:28:00,1637,That
65921,47:28:00,51,(is) because they
65922,47:28:00,1542,followed
65923,47:28:00,933,what
65924,47:28:00,1474,angered
65925,47:28:00,25,Allah
65926,47:28:00,766,and hated
65927,47:28:00,1226,His pleasure
65928,47:28:00,556,so He made worthless
65929,47:28:00,133,their deeds.
65930,47:29:00,37,Or do
65931,47:29:00,617,think
65932,47:29:00,29,those who
65933,47:29:00,439,in
65934,47:29:00,1152,their hearts
65935,47:29:00,981,(is) a disease
65936,47:29:00,47,that
65937,47:29:00,907,never
65938,47:29:00,830,will Allah bring forth
65939,47:29:00,25,will Allah bring forth
65940,47:29:00,305,their hatred?
65941,47:30:00,917,And if
65942,47:30:00,1424,We willed
65943,47:30:00,1214,surely We could show them to you
65944,47:30:00,153,and you would know them
65945,47:30:00,1530,by their marks;
65946,47:30:00,153,but surely you will know them
65947,47:30:00,439,by
65948,47:30:00,894,(the) tone
65949,47:30:00,1205,(of their) speech.
65950,47:30:00,25,And Allah
65951,47:30:00,126,knows
65952,47:30:00,133,your deeds.
65953,47:31:00,248,And surely We will test you
65954,47:31:00,624,until
65955,47:31:00,126,We make evident
65956,47:31:00,670,those who strive
65957,47:31:00,974,among you
65958,47:31:00,1311,and the patient ones
65959,47:31:00,248,and We will test
65960,47:31:00,796,your affairs.
65961,47:32:00,51,Indeed
65962,47:32:00,29,those who
65963,47:32:00,742,disbelieve
65964,47:32:00,1315,and turn away
65965,47:32:00,139,from
65966,47:32:00,1439,(the) way of Allah
65967,47:32:00,25,(the) way of Allah
65968,47:32:00,1401,and oppose
65969,47:32:00,1283,the Messenger
65970,47:32:00,974,after
65971,47:32:00,213,after
65972,47:32:00,933,[what]
65973,47:32:00,297,(has been) made clear
65974,47:32:00,865,to them
65975,47:32:00,507,the guidance
65976,47:32:00,907,never
65977,47:32:00,318,will they harm
65978,47:32:00,25,Allah
65979,47:32:00,1424,(in) anything
65980,47:32:00,556,and He will make worthless
65981,47:32:00,133,their deeds.
65982,47:33:00,96,O you who believe!
65983,47:33:00,29,O you who believe!
65984,47:33:00,42,O you who believe!
65985,47:33:00,1593,Obey
65986,47:33:00,25,Allah

65990,47:33:00,284,make vain
65991,47:33:00,133,your deeds.
65992,47:34:00,51,Indeed
65993,47:34:00,29,those who
65994,47:34:00,742,disbelieve
65995,47:34:00,1315,and turn away
65996,47:34:00,139,from
65997,47:34:00,1439,(the) way
65998,47:34:00,25,(of) Allah
65999,47:34:00,1613,then
66000,47:34:00,1010,died
66001,47:34:00,516,while they
66002,47:34:00,742,(were) disbelievers
66003,47:34:00,907,never
66004,47:34:00,454,will Allah forgive
66005,47:34:00,25,will Allah forgive
66006,47:34:00,865,them.
66007,47:35:00,866,So (do) not
66008,47:35:00,1671,weaken
66009,47:35:00,327,and call
66010,47:35:00,36,for
66011,47:35:00,1481,peace
66012,47:35:00,56,while you
66013,47:35:00,129,(are) superior
66014,47:35:00,25,and Allah
66015,47:35:00,937,(is) with you
66016,47:35:00,907,and never
66017,47:35:00,1717,will deprive you
66018,47:35:00,133,(of) your deeds.
66019,47:36:00,52,Only
66020,47:36:00,648,the life
66021,47:36:00,354,(of) the world
66022,47:36:00,869,(is) play
66023,47:36:00,890,and amusement.
66024,47:36:00,47,And if
66025,47:36:00,42,you believe
66026,47:36:00,1697,and fear (Allah)
66027,47:36:00,73,He will give you
66028,47:36:00,19,your rewards
66029,47:36:00,866,and not
66030,47:36:00,1429,will ask you
66031,47:36:00,1007,(for) your wealth.
66032,47:37:00,47,If
66033,47:37:00,1429,He were to ask you for it
66034,47:37:00,566,and press you
66035,47:37:00,241,you will withhold
66036,47:37:00,830,and He will bring forth
66037,47:37:00,305,your hatred.
66038,47:38:00,56,Here you are -
66039,47:38:00,87,these
66040,47:38:00,327,called
66041,47:38:00,1043,to spend
66042,47:38:00,439,in
66043,47:38:00,1439,(the) way
66044,47:38:00,25,(of) Allah -
66045,47:38:00,974,but among you
66046,47:38:00,974,(are some) who
66047,47:38:00,241,withhold
66048,47:38:00,974,and whoever
66049,47:38:00,241,withholds
66050,47:38:00,52,then only
66051,47:38:00,241,he withholds
66052,47:38:00,139,from
66053,47:38:00,1046,himself.
66054,47:38:00,25,But Allah
66055,47:38:00,468,(is) Free of need
66056,47:38:00,56,while you
66057,47:38:00,399,(are) the needy.
66058,47:38:00,47,And if
66059,47:38:00,1688,you turn away
66060,47:38:00,221,He
66061,47:38:00,1206,(with) a people
66062,47:38:00,491,other than you
66063,47:38:00,1613,then
66064,47:38:00,866,not
66065,47:38:00,785,they will be
66066,47:38:00,1004,(the) likes of you.
66067,48:01:00,1493,In (the) name
66068,48:01:00,25,(of) Allah
66069,48:01:00,1248,the Most Gracious
66070,48:01:00,1248,the Most Merciful.
66071,48:01:00,51,Indeed
66072,48:01:00,424,We have given victory
66073,48:01:00,865,to you
66074,48:01:00,424,a victory
66075,48:01:00,297,clear.
66076,48:02:00,454,That may forgive
66077,48:02:00,865,for you
66078,48:02:00,25,Allah
66079,48:02:00,933,what
66080,48:02:00,1143,preceded
66081,48:02:00,974,of
66082,48:02:00,1640,your sins
66083,48:02:00,933,and what
66084,48:02:00,21,will follow
66085,48:02:00,1551,and complete
66086,48:02:00,1022,His favor
66087,48:02:00,130,upon you
66088,48:02:00,507,and guide you
66089,48:02:00,1355,(to) a Path
66090,48:02:00,1206,Straight
66091,48:03:00,1089,And Allah may help you
66092,48:03:00,25,And Allah may help you
66093,48:03:00,1089,(with) a help
66094,48:03:00,207,mighty.
66095,48:04:00,534,He
66096,48:04:00,29,(is) the One Who
66097,48:04:00,1128,sent down
66098,48:04:00,1470,[the] tranquility
66099,48:04:00,439,in(to)
66100,48:04:00,1152,(the) hearts
66101,48:04:00,42,(of) the believers
66102,48:04:00,1795,that they may increase
66103,48:04:00,42,(in) faith
66104,48:04:00,937,with
66105,48:04:00,42,their faith.
66106,48:04:00,25,And for Allah
66107,48:04:00,690,(are the) hosts
66108,48:04:00,1493,(of) the heavens
66109,48:04:00,61,and the earth
66110,48:04:00,785,and Allah
66111,48:04:00,25,and Allah
66112,48:04:00,126,(is) All-Knower
66113,48:04:00,572,All-Wise.
66114,48:05:00,342,That He may admit
66115,48:05:00,42,the believing men
66116,48:05:00,42,and the believing women
66117,48:05:00,693,(to) Gardens
66118,48:05:00,701,flow
66119,48:05:00,974,from

66121,48:05:00,1052,the rivers
66122,48:05:00,813,(to) abide forever
66123,48:05:00,439,therein
66124,48:05:00,742,and (to) remove
66125,48:05:00,139,from them
66126,48:05:00,1523,their misdeeds
66127,48:05:00,785,and is
66128,48:05:00,1637,that

66131,48:05:00,438,a success
66132,48:05:00,201,great.
66133,48:06:00,184,And He (may) punish
66134,48:06:00,1043,the hypocrite men
66135,48:06:00,1043,and the hypocrite women

66137,48:06:00,1407,and the polytheist women
66138,48:06:00,1757,who assume
66139,48:06:00,25,about Allah
66140,48:06:00,1757,an assumption
66141,48:06:00,1523,evil.
66142,48:06:00,130,Upon them
66143,48:06:00,370,(is) a turn

66151,48:06:00,672,Hell
66152,48:06:00,1523,and evil
66153,48:06:00,1365,(is the) destination.

66162,48:08:00,51,Indeed We
66163,48:08:00,1283,[We] have sent you

66525,48:26:00,1697,(of) righteousness
66526,48:26:00,785,and they were

66611,48:29:00,98,then strengthens it
66612,48:29:00,462,then it becomes thick

66740,49:07:00,25,Allah
66741,49:07:00,551,has endeared
66742,49:07:00,36,to you
66743,49:07:00,42,the Faith
66744,49:07:00,1798,and has made it pleasing

66761,49:08:00,572,All-Wise.
66762,49:09:00,47,And if

68313,53:40:00,1433,his striving
68314,53:40:00,1526,will soon
68315,53:40:00,1214,be seen.
68316,53:41:00,1613,Then
68317,53:41:00,725,he will be recompensed for it
68318,53:41:00,725,the recompense

68320,53:42:00,51,And that
68321,53:42:00,36,to
68322,53:42:00,1219,your Lord
68323,53:42:00,1053,(is) the final goal.
68324,53:43:00,51,And that He
68325,53:43:00,534,[He]
68326,53:43:00,308,makes (one) laugh
68327,53:43:00,239,and makes (one) weep.

68348,53:48:00,1167,and suffices.
68349,53:49:00,51,And that He
68350,53:49:00,534,[He]

68373,53:54:00,477,covered.
68374,53:55:00,96,Then which (of)

69820,57:19:00,19,(is) their reward
69821,57:19:00,1117,and their light.
69822,57:19:00,29,But those who
69823,57:19:00,742,disbelieve
69824,57:19:00,781,and deny
69825,57:19:00,90,Our Verses

69829,57:20:00,126,Know
69830,57:20:00,52,that
69831,57:20:00,648,the life
69832,57:20:00,354,(of) the world
69833,57:20:00,869,(is) play
69834,57:20:00,890,and amusement
69835,57:20:00,1798,and adornment
69836,57:20:00,388,and boasting

69841,57:20:00,1686,and the children
69842,57:20:00,1004,like (the) example
69843,57:20:00,487,(of) a rain

69848,57:20:00,543,it dries
69849,57:20:00,1214,and you see it
69850,57:20:00,1324,turning yellow;
69851,57:20:00,1613,then
69852,57:20:00,785,becomes
69853,57:20:00,626,debris.
69854,57:20:00,439,And in
69855,57:20:00,21,the Hereafter
69856,57:20:00,184,(is) a punishment
69857,57:20:00,1373,severe
69858,57:20:00,454,and forgiveness
69859,57:20:00,974,from

69874,57:21:00,152,its width
69875,57:21:00,152,(is) like (the) width
69876,57:21:00,1493,(of) the heaven
69877,57:21:00,61,and the earth
69878,57:21:00,110,prepared

69882,57:21:00,1283,and His Messengers.
69883,57:21:00,1637,That
69884,57:21:00,377,(is the) Bounty
69885,57:21:00,25,(of) Allah
69886,57:21:00,73,He gives
69887,57:21:00,974,(to) whom
69888,57:21:00,1424,He wills.
69889,57:21:00,25,And Allah
69890,57:21:00,1646,(is) the Possessor of Bounty
69891,57:21:00,377,(is) the Possessor of Bounty
69892,57:21:00,201,the Great.

69903,57:22:00,439,in
69904,57:22:00,777,a Register

69907,57:22:00,47,that
69908,57:22:00,259,We bring it into existence.
69909,57:22:00,51,Indeed
69910,57:22:00,1637,that
69911,57:22:00,130,for
69912,57:22:00,25,Allah
69913,57:22:00,1747,(is) easy.
69914,57:23:00,788,So that you may not
69915,57:23:00,72,grieve
69916,57:23:00,130,over
69917,57:23:00,933,what
69918,57:23:00,437,has escaped you
69919,57:23:00,866,and (do) not
69920,57:23:00,406,exult
69921,57:23:00,251,at what
69922,57:23:00,73,He has given you.
69923,57:23:00,25,And Allah
69924,57:23:00,866,(does) not
69925,57:23:00,551,love
69926,57:23:00,753,every

69928,57:23:00,388,boaster
69929,57:24:00,29,Those who
69930,57:24:00,241,are stingy
69931,57:24:00,43,and enjoin
69932,57:24:00,1120,(on) the people
69933,57:24:00,241,stinginess.
69934,57:24:00,974,And whoever
69935,57:24:00,1688,turns away
69936,57:24:00,51,then indeed
69937,57:24:00,25,Allah
69938,57:24:00,534,He
69939,57:24:00,468,(is) Free of need
69940,57:24:00,581,the Praiseworthy.
69941,57:25:00,1140,Certainly
69942,57:25:00,1283,We sent
69943,57:25:00,1283,Our Messengers
69944,57:25:00,297,with clear proofs
69945,57:25:00,1128,and We sent down
69946,57:25:00,937,with them
69947,57:25:00,777,the Scripture
69948,57:25:00,1727,and the Balance
69949,57:25:00,1206,that may establish
69950,57:25:00,1120,the people
69951,57:25:00,1190,justice.
69952,57:25:00,1128,And We sent down
69953,57:25:00,560,[the] iron
69954,57:25:00,439,wherein
69955,57:25:00,211,(is) power
69956,57:25:00,1373,mighty
69957,57:25:00,1038,and benefits
69958,57:25:00,1120,for the people
69959,57:25:00,126,and so that Allah may make evident
69960,57:25:00,25,and so that Allah may make evident
69961,57:25:00,974,(he) who
69962,57:25:00,1089,helps Him
69963,57:25:00,1283,and His Messengers
69964,57:25:00,489,unseen.
69965,57:25:00,51,Indeed
69966,57:25:00,25,Allah
69967,57:25:00,1209,(is) All-Strong
69968,57:25:00,207,All-Mighty.
69969,57:26:00,1140,And certainly
69970,57:26:00,1283,We sent
69971,57:26:00,1113,Nuh
69972,57:26:00,5,and Ibrahim
69973,57:26:00,655,and We placed
69974,57:26:00,439,in
69975,57:26:00,1644,their offspring
69976,57:26:00,1025,Prophethood
69977,57:26:00,777,and the Scripture;
69978,57:26:00,974,and among them
69979,57:26:00,507,(is) a guided one
69980,57:26:00,780,but most
69981,57:26:00,974,of them
69982,57:26:00,421,(are) defiantly disobediently.
69983,57:27:00,1613,Then
69984,57:27:00,1148,We sent
69985,57:27:00,130,on
69986,57:27:00,76,their footsteps
69987,57:27:00,1283,Our Messengers
69988,57:27:00,1148,and We followed
69989,57:27:00,199,with Isa
69990,57:27:00,254,son
69991,57:27:00,989,(of) Maryam
69992,57:27:00,73,and We gave him
69993,57:27:00,1061,the Injeel.
69994,57:27:00,655,And We placed
69995,57:27:00,439,in
69996,57:27:00,1152,(the) hearts
69997,57:27:00,29,(of) those who
69998,57:27:00,1542,followed him
69999,57:27:00,1212,compassion
70000,57:27:00,1248,and mercy.
70001,57:27:00,1241,But monasticism
70002,57:27:00,220,they innovated -
70003,57:27:00,933,not
70004,57:27:00,777,We prescribed it
70005,57:27:00,130,for them -
70006,57:27:00,27,only
70007,57:27:00,228,seeking
70008,57:27:00,1226,(the) pleasure
70009,57:27:00,25,(of) Allah
70010,57:27:00,933,but not
70011,57:27:00,1217,they observed it
70012,57:27:00,595,(with) right
70013,57:27:00,1217,observance.
70014,57:27:00,73,So We gave
70015,57:27:00,29,those who
70016,57:27:00,42,believed
70017,57:27:00,974,among them
70018,57:27:00,19,their reward
70019,57:27:00,780,but most
70020,57:27:00,974,of them
70021,57:27:00,421,(are) defiantly disobediently.
70022,57:28:00,96,O you who believe!
70023,57:28:00,29,O you who believe!
70024,57:28:00,42,O you who believe!
70025,57:28:00,1697,Fear
70026,57:28:00,25,Allah
70027,57:28:00,42,and believe
70028,57:28:00,1283,in His Messenger;
70029,57:28:00,73,He will give you
70030,57:28:00,741,double portion
70031,57:28:00,974,of
70032,57:28:00,1248,His Mercy
70033,57:28:00,655,and He will make
70034,57:28:00,865,for you
70035,57:28:00,1117,a light
70036,57:28:00,992,you will walk
70037,57:28:00,208,with it
70038,57:28:00,454,and He will forgive
70039,57:28:00,865,you.
70040,57:28:00,25,And Allah
70041,57:28:00,454,(is) Oft-Forgiving
70042,57:28:00,1248,Most Merciful.
70043,57:29:00,27,So that
70044,57:29:00,126,may know
70045,57:29:00,15,(the) People
70046,57:29:00,777,(of) the Book
70047,57:29:00,27,that not
70048,57:29:00,1144,they have power
70049,57:29:00,130,over
70050,57:29:00,1424,anything
70051,57:29:00,974,from
70052,57:29:00,377,(the) Bounty
70053,57:29:00,25,(of) Allah
70054,57:29:00,51,and that
70055,57:29:00,377,the Bounty
70056,57:29:00,1732,(is) in Allah's Hand;
70057,57:29:00,25,(is) in Allah's Hand;
70058,57:29:00,73,He gives it
70059,57:29:00,974,whom
70060,57:29:00,1424,He wills.
70061,57:29:00,25,And Allah
70062,57:29:00,1646,(is) the Possessor of Bounty
70063,57:29:00,377,(is) the Possessor of Bounty
70064,57:29:00,201,the Great.
70065,58:01:00,1493,In (the) name
70066,58:01:00,25,(of) Allah
70067,58:01:00,1248,the Most Gracious
70068,58:01:00,1248,the Most Merciful.
70069,58:01:00,1140,Indeed
70070,58:01:00,1487,Allah has heard
70071,58:01:00,25,Allah has heard
70072,58:01:00,1205,(the) speech
70073,58:01:00,28,(of one) who
70074,58:01:00,664,disputes with you
70075,58:01:00,439,concerning
70076,58:01:00,1792,her husband
70077,58:01:00,1393,and she directs her complaint
70078,58:01:00,36,to
70079,58:01:00,25,Allah.
70080,58:01:00,25,And Allah
70081,58:01:00,1487,hears
70082,58:01:00,633,(the) dialogue of both of you.
70083,58:01:00,51,Indeed
70084,58:01:00,25,Allah
70085,58:01:00,1487,(is) All-Hearer
70086,58:01:00,272,All-Seer.
70087,58:02:00,29,Those who
70088,58:02:00,1753,pronounce zihar
70089,58:02:00,974,among you
70090,58:02:00,974,[from]
70091,58:02:00,1103,(to) their wives
70092,58:02:00,933,not
70093,58:02:00,524,they
70094,58:02:00,40,(are) their mothers.
70095,58:02:00,47,Not
70096,58:02:00,40,(are) their mothers
70097,58:02:00,27,except
70098,58:02:00,26,those who
70099,58:02:00,1686,gave them
70100,58:02:00,51,And indeed they
70101,58:02:00,1205,surely say
70102,58:02:00,1070,an evil
70103,58:02:00,974,[of]
70104,58:02:00,1205,[the] word
70105,58:02:00,1794,and a lie.
70106,58:02:00,51,But indeed
70107,58:02:00,25,Allah
70108,58:02:00,117,(is) surely Oft-Pardoning
70109,58:02:00,454,Oft-Forgiving.
70110,58:03:00,29,And those who
70111,58:03:00,1753,pronounce zihar
70112,58:03:00,974,[from]
70113,58:03:00,1103,(to) their wives
70114,58:03:00,1613,then
70115,58:03:00,186,go back
70116,58:03:00,901,on what
70117,58:03:00,1205,they said
70118,58:03:00,604,then freeing
70119,58:03:00,1274,(of) a slave
70120,58:03:00,974,before
70121,58:03:00,1134,before
70122,58:03:00,47,[that]
70123,58:03:00,997,they touch each other.
70124,58:03:00,1637,That
70125,58:03:00,1654,you are admonished
70126,58:03:00,208,to it.
70127,58:03:00,25,And Allah
70128,58:03:00,251,of what
70129,58:03:00,133,you do
70130,58:03:00,796,(is) All-Aware.
70131,58:04:00,974,Then whoever
70132,58:04:00,900,(does) not
70133,58:04:00,1677,find
70134,58:04:00,1359,then fasting
70135,58:04:00,1383,(for) two months
70136,58:04:00,1542,consecutively
70137,58:04:00,974,before
70138,58:04:00,1134,before

70808,59:12:00,1688,certainly they will turn

70820,59:13:00,1637,That

70824,59:13:00,398,(who do) not understand.

70842,59:14:00,1413,(are) divided.
70843,59:14:00,1637,That

70858,59:15:00,30,painful.
70859,59:16:00,1004,Like (the) example
70860,59:16:00,1416,(of) the Shaitaan

72111,64:13:00,534,Him.
72112,64:13:00,130,And upon
72113,64:13:00,25,Allah
72114,64:13:00,1684,let put (their) trust
72115,64:13:00,42,the believers.
72116,64:14:00,96,O you who believe!
72117,64:14:00,29,O you who believe!
72118,64:14:00,42,O you who believe!
72119,64:14:00,51,Indeed
72120,64:14:00,974,from
72121,64:14:00,1792,your spouses
72122,64:14:00,1686,and your children
72123,64:14:00,114,(are) enemies
72124,64:14:00,865,to you
72125,64:14:00,629,so beware of them.
72126,64:14:00,47,But if
72127,64:14:00,117,you pardon
72128,64:14:00,1322,and overlook
72129,64:14:00,454,and forgive
72130,64:14:00,51,then indeed
72131,64:14:00,25,Allah
72132,64:14:00,454,(is) Oft-Forgiving
72133,64:14:00,1248,Most Merciful.
72134,64:15:00,52,Only
72135,64:15:00,1007,your wealth
72136,64:15:00,1686,and your children
72137,64:15:00,426,(are) a trial
72138,64:15:00,25,and Allah -
72139,64:15:00,141,with Him
72140,64:15:00,19,(is) a reward
72141,64:15:00,201,great.
72142,64:16:00,1697,So fear
72143,64:16:00,25,Allah
72144,64:16:00,933,what
72145,64:16:00,1593,you are able
72146,64:16:00,1487,and listen
72147,64:16:00,1593,and obey
72148,64:16:00,1043,and spend;
72149,64:16:00,861,(it is) better
72150,64:16:00,1046,for yourselves.
72151,64:16:00,974,And whoever
72152,64:16:00,1697,is saved
72153,64:16:00,1385,(from the) greediness
72154,64:16:00,1046,(of) his soul
72155,64:16:00,87,then those
72156,64:16:00,516,[they]
72157,64:16:00,389,(are) the successful ones.
72158,64:17:00,47,If
72159,64:17:00,1171,you loan
72160,64:17:00,25,(to) Allah
72161,64:17:00,1171,a loan
72162,64:17:00,620,goodly
72163,64:17:00,301,He will multiply it
72164,64:17:00,865,for you
72165,64:17:00,454,and will forgive
72166,64:17:00,865,you.
72167,64:17:00,25,And Allah
72168,64:17:00,1391,(is) Most Appreciative
72169,64:17:00,575,Most Forbearing
72170,64:18:00,126,(The) Knower
72171,64:18:00,489,(of) the unseen
72172,64:18:00,1381,and the witnessed
72173,64:18:00,207,the All-Mighty
72174,64:18:00,572,the All-Wise.
72175,65:01:00,1493,In (the) name
72176,65:01:00,25,(of) Allah
72177,65:01:00,1248,the Most Gracious
72178,65:01:00,1248,the Most Merciful.
72179,65:01:00,96,O Prophet!
72180,65:01:00,1025,O Prophet!
72181,65:01:00,79,When
72182,65:01:00,1579,you divorce
72183,65:01:00,1103,[the] women
72184,65:01:00,1579,then divorce them
72185,65:01:00,110,for their waiting period
72186,65:01:00,615,and keep count
72187,65:01:00,110,(of) the waiting period
72188,65:01:00,1697,and fear
72189,65:01:00,25,Allah
72190,65:01:00,1219,your Lord.
72191,65:01:00,866,(Do) not
72192,65:01:00,830,expel them
72193,65:01:00,974,from
72194,65:01:00,298,their houses
72195,65:01:00,866,and not
72196,65:01:00,830,they should leave
72197,65:01:00,27,except
72198,65:01:00,47,that
72199,65:01:00,73,they commit
72200,65:01:00,381,an immorality
72201,65:01:00,297,clear.
72202,65:01:00,1548,And these
72203,65:01:00,560,(are the) limits
72204,65:01:00,25,(of) Allah.
72205,65:01:00,974,And whoever
72206,65:01:00,114,transgresses
72207,65:01:00,560,(the) limits
72208,65:01:00,25,(of) Allah
72209,65:01:00,1140,then certainly
72210,65:01:00,1755,he has wronged
72211,65:01:00,1046,himself.
72212,65:01:00,866,Not
72213,65:01:00,361,you know;
72214,65:01:00,870,Perhaps
72215,65:01:00,25,Allah
72216,65:01:00,562,will bring about
72217,65:01:00,213,after
72218,65:01:00,1637,that
72219,65:01:00,43,a matter.
72220,65:02:00,79,Then when
72221,65:02:00,246,they have reached
72222,65:02:00,18,their term
72223,65:02:00,995,then retain them
72224,65:02:00,153,with kindness
72225,65:02:00,82,or
72226,65:02:00,408,part with them
72227,65:02:00,153,with kindness.
72228,65:02:00,1381,And take witness
72229,65:02:00,1646,two men
72230,65:02:00,111,just
72231,65:02:00,974,among you
72232,65:02:00,1206,and establish
72233,65:02:00,1381,the testimony
72234,65:02:00,25,for Allah.
72235,65:02:00,1637,That
72236,65:02:00,1654,is instructed
72237,65:02:00,208,with it
72238,65:02:00,974,whoever
72239,65:02:00,785,[is]
72240,65:02:00,42,believes
72241,65:02:00,25,in Allah
72242,65:02:00,1750,and the Day
72243,65:02:00,21,the Last.
72244,65:02:00,974,And whoever
72245,65:02:00,1697,fears Allah
72246,65:02:00,25,fears Allah
72247,65:02:00,655,He will make
72248,65:02:00,865,for him
72249,65:02:00,830,a way out
72250,65:03:00,1301,And He will provide for him
72251,65:03:00,974,from
72252,65:03:00,647,where
72253,65:03:00,866,not
72254,65:03:00,617,he thinks.
72255,65:03:00,974,And whoever
72256,65:03:00,1684,puts his
72257,65:03:00,130,upon
72258,65:03:00,25,Allah
72259,65:03:00,534,then He
72260,65:03:00,617,(is) sufficient for him.
72261,65:03:00,51,Indeed
72262,65:03:00,25,Allah
72263,65:03:00,246,(will) accomplish
72264,65:03:00,43,His purpose.
72265,65:03:00,1140,Indeed
72266,65:03:00,655,Allah has set
72267,65:03:00,25,Allah has set
72268,65:03:00,753,for every
72269,65:03:00,1424,thing
72270,65:03:00,1144,a measure.
72271,65:04:00,26,And those who
72272,65:04:00,1729,have despaired
72273,65:04:00,974,of
72274,65:04:00,640,the menstruation

72278,65:04:00,1298,you doubt
72279,65:04:00,110,then their waiting period
72280,65:04:00,1611,(is) three
72281,65:04:00,1383,months
72282,65:04:00,26,and the ones who
72283,65:04:00,900,not

72291,65:04:00,974,And whoever

72297,65:04:00,43,his affair
72298,65:04:00,1747,ease.
72299,65:05:00,1637,That
72300,65:05:00,43,(is the) Command of Allah
72301,65:05:00,25,(is the) Command of Allah
72302,65:05:00,1128,which He has sent down
72303,65:05:00,36,to you;
72304,65:05:00,974,and whoever
72305,65:05:00,1697,fears Allah
72306,65:05:00,25,fears Allah
72307,65:05:00,742,He will remove
72308,65:05:00,139,from
72309,65:05:00,1523,his evil deeds
72310,65:05:00,201,and make great
72311,65:05:00,865,for him
72312,65:05:00,19,(his) reward.
72313,65:06:00,1470,Lodge them
72314,65:06:00,974,[from] where

72318,65:06:00,1677,your means
72319,65:06:00,866,and (do) not

72321,65:06:00,323,to distress
72322,65:06:00,130,[on] them.
72323,65:06:00,47,And if
72324,65:06:00,785,they are
72325,65:06:00,86,pregnant
72326,65:06:00,582,pregnant
72327,65:06:00,1043,then spend

72331,65:06:00,582,their burden.
72332,65:06:00,47,Then if
72333,65:06:00,1225,they suckle
72334,65:06:00,865,for you
72335,65:06:00,73,then give them
72336,65:06:00,19,their payment
72337,65:06:00,43,and consult
72338,65:06:00,297,among yourselves
72339,65:06:00,153,with kindness
72340,65:06:00,47,but if
72341,65:06:00,172,you disagree

72345,65:07:00,1043,Let spend

72369,65:07:00,1747,ease.
72370,65:08:00,729,And how many

72374,65:08:00,139,against
72375,65:08:00,43,(the) Command

72377,65:08:00,1283,and His Messengers
72378,65:08:00,617,so We took it to account
72379,65:08:00,617,an account
72380,65:08:00,1373,severe;
72381,65:08:00,184,and We punished it
72382,65:08:00,184,a punishment
72383,65:08:00,1070,terrible.
72384,65:09:00,1648,So it tasted
72385,65:09:00,1655,(the bad) consequence
72386,65:09:00,43,(of) its affair
72387,65:09:00,785,and was
72388,65:09:00,146,(the) end
72389,65:09:00,43,(of) its affair
72390,65:09:00,843,loss.
72391,65:10:00,110,Allah has prepared
72392,65:10:00,25,Allah has prepared
72393,65:10:00,865,for them
72394,65:10:00,184,a punishment
72395,65:10:00,1373,severe.
72396,65:10:00,1697,So fear Allah
72397,65:10:00,25,So fear Allah
72398,65:10:00,86,O men of understanding

72426,65:11:00,1337,righteous deeds
72427,65:11:00,342,He will admit him

74416,73:09:00,1684,(as) Disposer of Affairs.
74417,73:10:00,1311,And be patient
74418,73:10:00,130,over
74419,73:10:00,933,what
74420,73:10:00,1205,they say
74421,73:10:00,510,and avoid them
74422,73:10:00,510,an avoidance
74423,73:10:00,687,gracious.
74424,73:11:00,1723,And leave Me
74425,73:11:00,781,and the deniers
74426,73:11:00,86,possessors
74427,73:11:00,1022,(of) the ease
74428,73:11:00,947,and allow them respite -
74429,73:11:00,1154,a little.
74430,73:12:00,51,Indeed
74431,73:12:00,879,with Us
74432,73:12:00,1069,(are) shackles
74433,73:12:00,676,and burning fire
74434,73:13:00,1563,And food
74435,73:13:00,1646,that
74436,73:13:00,476,chokes
74437,73:13:00,184,and a punishment
74438,73:13:00,30,painful.
74439,73:14:00,1750,(On the) Day
74440,73:14:00,1251,will quake

74452,73:15:00,130,upon you
74453,73:15:00,757,as

74457,73:15:00,1283,a Messenger.
74458,73:16:00,166,But disobeyed
74459,73:16:00,400,Firaun
74460,73:16:00,1283,the Messenger
74461,73:16:00,22,so We seized him
74462,73:16:00,22,(with) a seizure
74463,73:16:00,1655,ruinous.
74464,73:17:00,790,Then how
74465,73:17:00,1697,will you guard yourselves
74466,73:17:00,47,if
74467,73:17:00,742,you disbelieve
74468,73:17:00,1750,a Day
74469,73:17:00,655,(that) will make
74470,73:17:00,1686,the children
74471,73:17:00,1426,gray-haired?
74472,73:18:00,1493,The heaven
74473,73:18:00,430,(will) break apart
74474,73:18:00,208,therefrom

74476,73:18:00,1652,His Promise

74485,73:19:00,1219,his Lord
74486,73:19:00,1439,a way.
74487,73:20:00,51,Indeed
74488,73:20:00,1219,your Lord
74489,73:20:00,126,knows
74490,73:20:00,51,that you

74492,73:20:00,354,(a little) less
74493,73:20:00,974,than

74497,73:20:00,1611,and a third of it
74498,73:20:00,1595,and (so do) a group
74499,73:20:00,974,of
74500,73:20:00,29,those who
74501,73:20:00,937,(are) with you.
74502,73:20:00,25,And Allah
74503,73:20:00,1144,determines
74504,73:20:00,926,the night
74505,73:20:00,1052,and the day.
74506,73:20:00,126,He knows

74515,73:20:00,974,of
74516,73:20:00,1168,the Quran.
74517,73:20:00,126,He knows
74518,73:20:00,47,that
74519,73:20:00,785,there will be
74520,73:20:00,974,among you
74521,73:20:00,981,sick

74523,73:20:00,317,traveling
74524,73:20:00,439,in
74525,73:20:00,61,the land
74526,73:20:00,228,seeking

74534,73:20:00,25,(of) Allah.
74535,73:20:00,1168,So recite
74536,73:20:00,933,what
74537,73:20:00,1747,is easy
74538,73:20:00,974,of it
74539,73:20:00,1206,and establish
74540,73:20:00,1339,the prayer
74541,73:20:00,73,and give

74545,73:20:00,1171,a loan
74546,73:20:00,620,goodly.
74547,73:20:00,933,And whatever
74548,73:20:00,1143,you send forth
74549,73:20:00,1046,for yourselves
74550,73:20:00,974,of
74551,73:20:00,861,good
74552,73:20:00,1677,you will find it
74553,73:20:00,141,with

74555,73:20:00,534,It
74556,73:20:00,861,(will be) better
74557,73:20:00,201,and greater
74558,73:20:00,19,(in) reward.
74559,73:20:00,454,And seek forgiveness
74560,73:20:00,25,(of) Allah.
74561,73:20:00,51,Indeed
74562,73:20:00,25,Allah
74563,73:20:00,454,(is) Oft-Forgiving
74564,73:20:00,1248,Most Merciful.
74565,74:01:00,1493,In (the) name
74566,74:01:00,25,(of) Allah
74567,74:01:00,1248,the Most Gracious
74568,74:01:00,1248,the Most Merciful.
74569,74:01:00,96,O you
74570,74:01:00,365,who covers himself!
74571,74:02:00,1206,Stand up
74572,74:02:00,1110,and warn

74576,74:04:00,1573,purify
74577,74:05:00,1257,And uncleanliness
74578,74:05:00,510,avoid
74579,74:06:00,866,And (do) not
74580,74:06:00,977,confer favor
74581,74:06:00,780,(to) acquire more
74582,74:07:00,1219,And for your Lord
74583,74:07:00,1311,be patient.
74584,74:08:00,79,Then when
74585,74:08:00,1083,is blown

74596,74:11:00,1723,Leave Me
74597,74:11:00,974,and whom
74598,74:11:00,816,I created
74599,74:11:00,1673,alone
74600,74:12:00,655,And I granted
74601,74:12:00,865,to him
74602,74:12:00,1007,wealth
74603,74:12:00,943,extensive

74607,74:14:00,865,for him
74608,74:14:00,946,ease.
74609,74:15:00,1613,Then
74610,74:15:00,1581,he desires
74611,74:15:00,47,that
74612,74:15:00,1795,I (should) add more.
74613,74:16:00,753,By no means!
74614,74:16:00,51,Indeed he
74615,74:16:00,785,has been
74616,74:16:00,90,to Our Verses
74617,74:16:00,141,stubborn.
74618,74:17:00,1243,Soon I will cover Him
74619,74:17:00,1303,(with) a laborious punishment.

74622,74:18:00,1144,and plotted.
74623,74:19:00,1193,So may he be destroyed
74624,74:19:00,790,how
74625,74:19:00,1144,he plotted!
74626,74:20:00,1613,Then

74631,74:21:00,1124,he looked;
74632,74:22:00,1613,Then
74633,74:22:00,104,he frowned
74634,74:22:00,277,and scowled;
74635,74:23:00,1613,Then
74636,74:23:00,329,he turned back
74637,74:23:00,734,and was proud

75720,79:33:00,865,for you
75721,79:33:00,1022,and for your cattle.
75722,79:34:00,79,But when
75723,79:34:00,720,comes
75724,79:34:00,1582,the Overwhelming Calamity
75725,79:34:00,734,the great
75726,79:35:00,1750,(The) Day
75727,79:35:00,1634,will remember
75728,79:35:00,54,man
75729,79:35:00,933,what
75730,79:35:00,1433,he strove (for)
75731,79:36:00,269,And will be made manifest
75732,79:36:00,676,the Hellfire
75733,79:36:00,974,to (him) who
75734,79:36:00,1214,sees
75735,79:37:00,41,Then as for
75736,79:37:00,974,(him) who
75737,79:37:00,1571,transgressed
75738,79:38:00,76,And preferred
75739,79:38:00,648,the life
75740,79:38:00,354,(of) the world
75741,79:39:00,51,Then indeed
75742,79:39:00,676,the Hellfire
75743,79:39:00,539,it
75744,79:39:00,88,(is) the refuge.
75745,79:40:00,41,But as for
75746,79:40:00,974,(him) who
75747,79:40:00,853,feared
75748,79:40:00,1206,standing
75749,79:40:00,1219,(before) his Lord
75750,79:40:00,1053,and restrained
75751,79:40:00,1046,his soul
75752,79:40:00,139,from
75753,79:40:00,538,the vain desires
75754,79:41:00,51,Then indeed
75755,79:41:00,693,Paradise -
75756,79:41:00,539,it (is)
75757,79:41:00,88,the refuge.
75758,79:42:00,1429,They ask you
75759,79:42:00,139,about
75760,79:42:00,1524,the Hour
75761,79:42:00,95,when
75762,79:42:00,1285,(is) its arrival?
75763,79:43:00,439,In what
75764,79:43:00,55,(are) you
75765,79:43:00,974,[of]
75766,79:43:00,1634,(to) mention it?
75767,79:44:00,36,To
75768,79:44:00,1219,your Lord
75769,79:44:00,1053,(is) its finality.
75770,79:45:00,52,Only
75771,79:45:00,55,you
75772,79:45:00,1110,(are) a warner
75773,79:45:00,974,(for him) who
75774,79:45:00,840,fears it.
75775,79:46:00,726,As though they
75776,79:46:00,1750,(the) Day
75777,79:46:00,1214,they see it
75778,79:46:00,900,not
75779,79:46:00,876,they had remained
75780,79:46:00,27,except
75781,79:46:00,168,an evening
75782,79:46:00,82,or
75783,79:46:00,309,a morning thereof.
75784,80:01:00,1493,In (the) name
75785,80:01:00,25,(of) Allah
75786,80:01:00,1248,the Most Gracious
75787,80:01:00,1248,the Most Merciful.
75788,80:01:00,104,He frowned
75789,80:01:00,1688,and turned away
75790,80:02:00,47,Because
75791,80:02:00,720,came to him
75792,80:02:00,138,the blind man.
75793,80:03:00,933,But what
75794,80:03:00,361,would make you know
75795,80:03:00,870,that he might
75796,80:03:00,1773,purify himself
75797,80:04:00,82,Or
75798,80:04:00,1634,be reminded
75799,80:04:00,1038,so would benefit him
75800,80:04:00,1634,the reminder?
75801,80:05:00,41,As for
75802,80:05:00,974,(him) who
75803,80:05:00,468,considers himself free from need
75804,80:06:00,55,So you
75805,80:06:00,865,to him
75806,80:06:00,1319,give attention.
75807,80:07:00,933,And not
75808,80:07:00,130,upon you
75809,80:07:00,27,that not
75810,80:07:00,1773,he purifies himself.
75811,80:08:00,41,But as for
75812,80:08:00,974,(he) who
75813,80:08:00,720,came to you
75814,80:08:00,1433,striving
75815,80:09:00,534,While he
75816,80:09:00,840,fears
75817,80:10:00,55,But you
75818,80:10:00,139,from
75819,80:10:00,890,(are) distracted.
75820,80:11:00,753,Nay!
75821,80:11:00,51,Indeed it
75822,80:11:00,1634,(is) a reminder
75823,80:12:00,974,So whosoever
75824,80:12:00,1424,wills
75825,80:12:00,1634,may remember it.
75826,80:13:00,439,In
75827,80:13:00,1331,sheets
75828,80:13:00,767,honored
75829,80:14:00,1232,Exalted
75830,80:14:00,1573,purified
75831,80:15:00,1732,In (the) hands
75832,80:15:00,1453,(of) scribes.
75833,80:16:00,767,Noble
75834,80:16:00,267,dutiful.
75835,80:17:00,1193,Is destroyed
75836,80:17:00,54,[the] man
75837,80:17:00,933,how
75838,80:17:00,742,ungrateful is he!
75839,80:18:00,974,From
75840,80:18:00,96,what
75841,80:18:00,1424,thing
75842,80:18:00,816,He created him?
75843,80:19:00,974,From
75844,80:19:00,1106,a semen-drop
75845,80:19:00,816,He created him
75846,80:19:00,1144,then He proportioned him
75847,80:20:00,1613,Then
75848,80:20:00,1439,the way
75849,80:20:00,1747,He made easy for him
75850,80:21:00,1613,Then
75851,80:21:00,1010,He causes him to die
75852,80:21:00,1135,and provides a grave for him
75853,80:22:00,1613,Then
75854,80:22:00,79,when
75855,80:22:00,1424,He wills
75856,80:22:00,1093,He will resurrect him.
75857,80:23:00,753,Nay!
75858,80:23:00,904,Not
75859,80:23:00,1139,he has accomplished
75860,80:23:00,933,what
75861,80:23:00,43,He commanded him.
75862,80:24:00,1124,Then let look
75863,80:24:00,54,the man
75864,80:24:00,36,at
75865,80:24:00,1563,his food
75866,80:25:00,51,That [We]
75867,80:25:00,1308,[We] poured
75868,80:25:00,1005,the water
75869,80:25:00,1308,(in) abundance
75870,80:26:00,1613,Then
75871,80:26:00,1401,We cleaved
75872,80:26:00,61,the earth
75873,80:26:00,1401,splitting
75874,80:27:00,1027,Then We caused to grow
75875,80:27:00,439,therein
75876,80:27:00,551,grain
75877,80:28:00,140,And grapes
75878,80:28:00,1137,and green fodder
75879,80:29:00,1799,And olive
75880,80:29:00,1074,and date-palms
75881,80:30:00,561,And gardens
75882,80:30:00,455,(of) thick foliage
75883,80:31:00,385,And fruits
75884,80:31:00,1,and grass
75885,80:32:00,999,(As) a provision
75886,80:32:00,865,for you
75887,80:32:00,1022,and for your cattle.
75888,80:33:00,79,But when
75889,80:33:00,720,comes
75890,80:33:00,1333,the Deafening Blast
75891,80:34:00,1750,(The) Day
75892,80:34:00,409,will flee
75893,80:34:00,980,a man
75894,80:34:00,974,from
75895,80:34:00,23,his brother
75896,80:35:00,40,And his mother
75897,80:35:00,6,and his father
75898,80:36:00,1330,And his wife
75899,80:36:00,254,and his children
75900,80:37:00,753,For every
75901,80:37:00,980,man
75902,80:37:00,974,among them
75903,80:37:00,1750,that Day
75904,80:37:00,1368,(will be) a matter
75905,80:37:00,468,occupying him.
75906,80:38:00,1679,Faces
75907,80:38:00,1750,that Day
75908,80:38:00,1453,(will be) bright
75909,80:39:00,308,Laughing
75910,80:39:00,273,rejoicing at good news.
75911,80:40:00,1679,And faces
75912,80:40:00,1750,that Day
75913,80:40:00,130,upon them
75914,80:40:00,447,(will be) dust
75915,80:41:00,1243,Will cover them
75916,80:41:00,1195,darkness.
75917,80:42:00,87,Those
75918,80:42:00,516,[they]
75919,80:42:00,742,(are) the disbelievers
75920,80:42:00,383,the wicked ones.
75921,81:01:00,1493,In (the) name
75922,81:01:00,25,(of) Allah
75923,81:01:00,1248,the Most Gracious
75924,81:01:00,1248,the Most Merciful.
75925,81:01:00,79,When
75926,81:01:00,1397,the sun
75927,81:01:00,786,is wrapped up
75928,81:02:00,79,And when
75929,81:02:00,1062,the stars
75930,81:02:00,737,fall losing their luster
75931,81:03:00,79,And when
75932,81:03:00,658,the mountains
75933,81:03:00,1539,are moved away
75934,81:04:00,79,And when
75935,81:04:00,167,the full-term she-camels
75936,81:04:00,180,(are) left untended;
75937,81:05:00,79,And when
75938,81:05:00,1674,the wild beasts
75939,81:05:00,616,are gathered
75940,81:06:00,79,And when
75941,81:06:00,233,the seas
75942,81:06:00,1467,are made to overflow
75943,81:07:00,79,And when
75944,81:07:00,1046,the souls
75945,81:07:00,1792,are paired
75946,81:08:00,79,And when
75947,81:08:00,1650,the female infant buried alive
75948,81:08:00,1429,is asked
75949,81:09:00,96,For what
75950,81:09:00,1640,sin
75951,81:09:00,1193,she was killed.
75952,81:10:00,79,And when
75953,81:10:00,1331,the pages
75954,81:10:00,1093,are laid open
75955,81:11:00,79,And when
75956,81:11:00,1493,the sky
75957,81:11:00,771,is stripped away
75958,81:12:00,79,And when
75959,81:12:00,676,the Hellfire
75960,81:12:00,1432,is set ablaze
75961,81:13:00,79,And when
75962,81:13:00,693,Paradise
75963,81:13:00,1775,is brought near
75964,81:14:00,126,Will know
75965,81:14:00,1046,a soul
75966,81:14:00,933,what
75967,81:14:00,558,it has brought.
75968,81:15:00,866,But nay!
75969,81:15:00,1187,I swear
75970,81:15:00,826,by the retreating planets
75971,81:16:00,701,Those that run
75972,81:16:00,763,(and) disappear
75973,81:17:00,926,And the night
75974,81:17:00,79,when
75975,81:17:00,169,it departs
75976,81:18:00,1310,And the dawn
75977,81:18:00,79,when
75978,81:18:00,1046,it breathes
75979,81:19:00,51,Indeed it
75980,81:19:00,1205,(is) surely a word
75981,81:19:00,1283,(of) a Messenger
75982,81:19:00,767,noble
75983,81:20:00,1646,Possessor of
75984,81:20:00,1209,power
75985,81:20:00,141,with
75986,81:20:00,1646,(the) Owner of
75987,81:20:00,158,the Throne
75988,81:20:00,960,secure
75989,81:21:00,1593,One to be obeyed
75990,81:21:00,1613,and
75991,81:21:00,42,trustworthy
75992,81:22:00,933,And not
75993,81:22:00,1330,(is) your companion
75994,81:22:00,693,mad.
75995,81:23:00,1140,And certainly
75996,81:23:00,1214,he saw
75997,81:23:00,14,in the horizon
75998,81:23:00,297,the clear.
75999,81:24:00,933,And not
76000,81:24:00,534,he (is)
76001,81:24:00,130,on
76002,81:24:00,489,the unseen
76003,81:24:00,315,a withholder.
76004,81:25:00,933,And not
76005,81:25:00,534,it
76006,81:25:00,1205,(is the) word
76007,81:25:00,1416,(of) Shaitaan
76008,81:25:00,1254,accursed.
76009,81:26:00,95,So where
76010,81:26:00,1632,are you going?
76011,81:27:00,47,Not
76012,81:27:00,534,it
76013,81:27:00,27,(is) except
76014,81:27:00,1634,a reminder
76015,81:27:00,126,to the worlds
76016,81:28:00,974,For whoever
76017,81:28:00,1424,wills
76018,81:28:00,974,among you
76019,81:28:00,47,to
76020,81:28:00,1206,take a straight way.
76021,81:29:00,933,And not
76022,81:29:00,1424,you will
76023,81:29:00,27,except
76024,81:29:00,47,that
76025,81:29:00,1424,wills
76026,81:29:00,25,Allah
76027,81:29:00,1219,Lord
76028,81:29:00,126,(of) the worlds.
76029,82:01:00,1493,In (the) name
76030,82:01:00,25,(of) Allah
76031,82:01:00,1248,the Most Gracious
76032,82:01:00,1248,the Most Merciful.
76033,82:01:00,79,When
76034,82:01:00,1493,the sky
76035,82:01:00,430,(is) cleft asunder
76036,82:02:00,79,And when
76037,82:02:00,784,the stars
76038,82:02:00,1109,scatter
76039,82:03:00,79,And when
76040,82:03:00,233,the seas
76041,82:03:00,383,are made to gush
76042,82:04:00,79,And when
76043,82:04:00,1135,the graves
76044,82:04:00,217,are overturned
76045,82:05:00,126,Will know

76052,82:06:00,933,What

76069,82:09:00,371,the Judgment.
76070,82:10:00,51,And indeed

76515,86:01:00,1589,and the night comer
76516,86:02:00,933,And what
76517,86:02:00,361,can make you know
76518,86:02:00,933,what

76520,86:03:00,1062,(It is) the star
76521,86:03:00,1617,the piercing!

76547,86:09:00,1516,the secrets

76565,86:14:00,548,(is) for amusement.
76566,86:15:00,51,Indeed they

76568,86:15:00,789,a plot
76569,86:16:00,789,But I am panning
76570,86:16:00,789,a plan.
76571,86:17:00,947,So give respite

76589,87:04:00,29,And the One Who
76590,87:04:00,830,brings forth
76591,87:04:00,1217,the pasture
76592,87:05:00,655,And then makes it
76593,87:05:00,482,stubble

76601,87:07:00,25,Allah

76604,87:07:00,673,the manifest
76605,87:07:00,933,and what
76606,87:07:00,811,is hidden.
76607,87:08:00,1747,And We will ease you
76608,87:08:00,1747,to the ease.
76609,87:09:00,1634,So remind
76610,87:09:00,47,if
76611,87:09:00,1038,benefits
76612,87:09:00,1634,the reminder.
76613,87:10:00,1634,He will pay heed -

76615,87:10:00,840,fears (Allah).
76616,87:11:00,689,And will avoid it
76617,87:11:00,1402,the wretched one.
76618,87:12:00,29,The one who
76619,87:12:00,1340,will burn

76625,87:13:00,439,therein
76626,87:13:00,866,and not
76627,87:13:00,648,will live.

76641,87:17:00,861,(is) better
76642,87:17:00,258,and everlasting.
76643,87:18:00,51,Indeed

77031,91:15:00,146,its consequences.
77032,92:01:00,1493,In (the) name
77033,92:01:00,25,(of) Allah
77034,92:01:00,1248,the Most Gracious
77035,92:01:00,1248,the Most Merciful.
77036,92:01:00,926,By the night
77037,92:01:00,79,when
77038,92:01:00,477,it covers
77039,92:02:00,1052,And the day
77040,92:02:00,79,when
77041,92:02:00,682,it shines in brightness
77042,92:03:00,933,And He Who
77043,92:03:00,816,created
77044,92:03:00,1634,the male
77045,92:03:00,57,and the female
77046,92:04:00,51,Indeed
77047,92:04:00,1433,your efforts
77048,92:04:00,1413,(are) surely diverse.
77049,92:05:00,41,Then as for
77050,92:05:00,974,(him) who
77051,92:05:00,181,gives
77052,92:05:00,1697,and fears
77053,92:06:00,1317,And believes
77054,92:06:00,620,in the best
77055,92:07:00,1747,Then We will ease him
77056,92:07:00,1747,towards [the] ease.
77057,92:08:00,41,But as for
77058,92:08:00,974,(him) who
77059,92:08:00,241,withholds
77060,92:08:00,468,and considers himself free from need
77061,92:09:00,781,And denies
77062,92:09:00,620,the best
77063,92:10:00,1747,Then We will ease him
77064,92:10:00,172,towards [the] difficulty.
77065,92:11:00,933,And not
77066,92:11:00,468,will avail
77067,92:11:00,139,him
77068,92:11:00,1007,his wealth
77069,92:11:00,79,when
77070,92:11:00,1231,he falls.
77071,92:12:00,51,Indeed
77072,92:12:00,130,upon Us
77073,92:12:00,507,(is) the guidance.
77074,92:13:00,51,And indeed
77075,92:13:00,865,for Us
77076,92:13:00,21,(is) the Hereafter
77077,92:13:00,86,and the first (life).
77078,92:14:00,1110,So I warn you
77079,92:14:00,1117,(of) a Fire
77080,92:14:00,930,blazing
77081,92:15:00,866,Not
77082,92:15:00,1340,will burn (in) it
77083,92:15:00,27,except
77084,92:15:00,1402,the most wretched
77085,92:16:00,29,The one who
77086,92:16:00,781,denied
77087,92:16:00,1688,and turned away.
77088,92:17:00,689,But will be removed from it
77089,92:17:00,1697,the righteous
77090,92:18:00,29,The one who
77091,92:18:00,73,gives
77092,92:18:00,1007,his wealth
77093,92:18:00,1773,(to) purify himself
77094,92:19:00,933,And not
77095,92:19:00,16,for anyone
77096,92:19:00,141,with him
77097,92:19:00,974,any
77098,92:19:00,1022,favor
77099,92:19:00,725,to be recompensed
77100,92:20:00,27,Except
77101,92:20:00,228,seeking
77102,92:20:00,1679,(the) Countenance
77103,92:20:00,1219,(of) his Lord
77104,92:20:00,129,the Most High.
77105,92:21:00,1526,And soon surely
77106,92:21:00,1226,he will be pleased.
77107,93:01:00,1493,In (the) name
77108,93:01:00,25,(of) Allah
77109,93:01:00,1248,the Most Gracious
77110,93:01:00,1248,the Most Merciful.
77111,93:01:00,309,By the morning brightness
77112,93:02:00,926,And the night
77113,93:02:00,79,when
77114,93:02:00,1468,it covers with darkness
77115,93:03:00,933,Not
77116,93:03:00,1660,has forsaken you
77117,93:03:00,1219,your Lord
77118,93:03:00,933,and not
77119,93:03:00,1156,He is displeased
77120,93:04:00,21,And surely the Hereafter
77121,93:04:00,861,(is) better
77122,93:04:00,865,for you
77123,93:04:00,974,than
77124,93:04:00,86,the first.
77125,93:05:00,1526,And soon
77126,93:05:00,181,will give you
77127,93:05:00,1219,your Lord
77128,93:05:00,1226,then you will be satisfied.
77129,93:06:00,900,Did not
77130,93:06:00,1677,He find you
77131,93:06:00,1748,an orphan
77132,93:06:00,88,and give shelter?
77133,93:07:00,1677,And He found you
77134,93:07:00,311,lost
77135,93:07:00,507,so He guided
77136,93:08:00,1677,And He found you
77137,93:08:00,195,in need
77138,93:08:00,468,so He made self-sufficient.
77139,93:09:00,41,So as for
77140,93:09:00,1748,the orphan
77141,93:09:00,866,then (do) not
77142,93:09:00,1149,oppress
77143,93:10:00,41,And as for
77144,93:10:00,1429,one who asks
77145,93:10:00,866,then (do) not
77146,93:10:00,1052,repel
77147,93:11:00,41,But as for
77148,93:11:00,1022,(the) Favor
77149,93:11:00,1219,(of) your Lord
77150,93:11:00,562,narrate.
77151,94:01:00,1493,In (the) name
77152,94:01:00,25,(of) Allah
77153,94:01:00,1248,the Most Gracious
77154,94:01:00,1248,the Most Merciful.
77155,94:01:00,900,Have not
77156,94:01:00,1406,We expanded
77157,94:01:00,865,for you
77158,94:01:00,1318,your breast?
77159,94:02:00,1658,And We removed
77160,94:02:00,139,from you
77161,94:02:00,1728,your burden
77162,94:03:00,29,Which
77163,94:03:00,1081,weighed upon
77164,94:03:00,1753,your back
77165,94:04:00,1232,And We raised high
77166,94:04:00,865,for you
77167,94:04:00,1634,your reputation
77168,94:05:00,51,So indeed
77169,94:05:00,937,with
77170,94:05:00,172,the hardship
77171,94:05:00,1747,(is) ease.
77172,94:06:00,51,Indeed
77173,94:06:00,937,with
77174,94:06:00,172,the hardship
77175,94:06:00,1747,(is) ease.
77176,94:07:00,79,So when
77177,94:07:00,404,you have finished
77178,94:07:00,1086,then labor hard.
77179,94:08:00,36,And to
77180,94:08:00,1219,your Lord
77181,94:08:00,1238,turn your attention.
77182,95:01:00,1493,In (the) name
77183,95:01:00,25,(of) Allah
77184,95:01:00,1248,the Most Gracious
77185,95:01:00,1248,the Most Merciful.
77186,95:01:00,1562,By the fig
77187,95:01:00,1799,and the olive
77188,95:02:00,1598,And (the) Mount
77189,95:02:00,1538,Sinai
77190,95:03:00,500,And this
77191,95:03:00,245,[the] city
77192,95:03:00,42,[the] secure
77193,95:04:00,1140,Indeed
77194,95:04:00,816,We created
77195,95:04:00,54,man
77196,95:04:00,439,in
77197,95:04:00,620,(the) best
77198,95:04:00,1206,mould.
77199,95:05:00,1613,Then
77200,95:05:00,1228,We returned him
77201,95:05:00,1451,(to the) lowest
77202,95:05:00,1451,(of the) low
77203,95:06:00,27,Except
77204,95:06:00,29,those who
77205,95:06:00,42,believe
77206,95:06:00,133,and do
77207,95:06:00,1337,righteous deeds
77208,95:06:00,865,then for them
77209,95:06:00,19,(is a) reward
77210,95:06:00,491,never
77211,95:06:00,977,ending.
77212,95:07:00,933,Then what
77213,95:07:00,781,causes you to deny
77214,95:07:00,213,after (this)
77215,95:07:00,371,the judgment?
77216,95:08:00,928,Is not
77217,95:08:00,25,Allah
77218,95:08:00,572,(the) Most Just
77219,95:08:00,572,(of) the Judges?

77231,96:02:00,974,from
77232,96:02:00,128,a clinging substance.

77244,96:06:00,753,Nay!
77245,96:06:00,51,Indeed
77246,96:06:00,54,man
77247,96:06:00,1571,surely transgresses
77248,96:07:00,47,That
77249,96:07:00,1214,he sees himself
77250,96:07:00,468,self-sufficient.
77251,96:08:00,51,Indeed
77252,96:08:00,36,to
77253,96:08:00,1219,your Lord
77254,96:08:00,1250,(is) the return.
77255,96:09:00,1214,Have you seen
77256,96:09:00,29,the one who
77257,96:09:00,1053,forbids

77289,96:18:00,327,We will call
